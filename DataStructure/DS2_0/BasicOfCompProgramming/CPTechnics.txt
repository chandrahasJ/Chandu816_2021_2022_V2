1) Pre-Computation helps to optimize the codes such that it perform within the time limit.
2) There many Pre-Computation technicis
    a) Hashing
3) Pre-Fix Sum = PreComputation
    a) save the addition of zeroth and first index in the second index.
    b) Always initialize the loop with 1 when doing Pre-Fix Sum.
4)
