1
00:01:41,886 --> 00:01:43,305
Oh, God!

2
00:01:43,918 --> 00:01:47,046
[Indistinct chatter]

3
00:01:53,111 --> 00:01:55,004
What has happened?

4
00:02:00,413 --> 00:02:01,834
What has happened?

5
00:02:12,138 --> 00:02:17,611
Oh, God! We have sinned
to suffer like this!

6
00:02:18,979 --> 00:02:21,951
Isn't there anyone who can help us?

7
00:02:31,833 --> 00:02:33,864
Listen.
- Get inside.

8
00:02:33,944 --> 00:02:35,759
This is the last warning for you.

9
00:02:35,952 --> 00:02:39,142
Badrinarayana,
our boss is planning to build,

10
00:02:39,222 --> 00:02:41,627
a multinational
company on this land.

11
00:02:42,009 --> 00:02:43,745
Mother and daughter!

12
00:02:43,825 --> 00:02:47,385
Vacate this place with your carts.

13
00:02:48,208 --> 00:02:52,609
Priest! You should leave
this place with your God.

14
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:55,513
These shops must close soon.

15
00:02:55,593 --> 00:02:56,944
Otherwise, you will die!

16
00:02:59,164 --> 00:03:01,086
Understand?
- Where are you going?

17
00:03:01,166 --> 00:03:02,308
You will suffer if you go against
my orders. - Where are you going?

18
00:03:02,388 --> 00:03:03,581
You cannot catch me!
- Where are you trying to run?

19
00:03:03,661 --> 00:03:05,580
You cannot catch me.
You cannot catch me.

20
00:03:07,617 --> 00:03:10,579
Oh, God! I am sorry, rowdy baby.

21
00:03:11,298 --> 00:03:12,409
Let us go.

22
00:03:12,489 --> 00:03:14,173
How dare he ask us
to vacate our slum?

23
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:15,895
Look at his face!

24
00:03:18,475 --> 00:03:22,191
How dare you laugh at me?

25
00:03:25,237 --> 00:03:26,297
Who is that?

26
00:03:26,377 --> 00:03:29,041
You must vacate this slum.
-How dare you laugh at me?

27
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:31,783
Look for him. Where is he?

28
00:03:34,363 --> 00:03:35,741
He looks like our leader.

29
00:03:35,821 --> 00:03:37,870
Brother, have you seen your face?

30
00:03:39,344 --> 00:03:41,150
Of course. Who else will see it?

31
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:43,827
Look there! A painting that
depicts people thrashing you.

32
00:03:51,551 --> 00:03:52,991
Hey, painter!

33
00:03:55,427 --> 00:03:58,480
Will it happen just
because you have drawn it?

34
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:01,191
Who has the guts to stamp me?

35
00:04:02,385 --> 00:04:03,583
Have you come?

36
00:04:03,663 --> 00:04:06,474
I knew you would
come but not so soon.

37
00:04:06,554 --> 00:04:08,391
Are you good?
Your time is not good. Go away.

38
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:11,878
Just wait. I will draw you properly.

39
00:04:15,532 --> 00:04:18,462
Call him. I am the daring
tiger sent by Badrinarayan.

40
00:04:18,542 --> 00:04:20,683
Call that guy.
I will wait here till he comes.

41
00:04:20,763 --> 00:04:21,799
Call him...

42
00:04:22,329 --> 00:04:23,313
Wait. He will come now.

43
00:04:23,393 --> 00:04:25,132
I will not leave this place.
I will be here.

44
00:04:25,212 --> 00:04:27,173
Yes, go there and pose
for my painting. - Call him...

45
00:04:27,253 --> 00:04:29,368
Sit in the auto. Who is that guy?

46
00:04:30,349 --> 00:04:32,854
Look under the auto.
- Under the auto?

47
00:04:32,934 --> 00:04:34,257
Is he not there?

48
00:04:34,337 --> 00:04:35,719
Where is he?
- Look up at the sky.

49
00:04:35,799 --> 00:04:36,717
He may drop down from there.
- Where is he?

50
00:04:36,797 --> 00:04:39,109
Is he not there? Oh, God!
- Where is he?

51
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:45,421
Water tank?

52
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:47,511
He is coming from
the direction of the water tank.

53
00:04:47,591 --> 00:04:48,591
He is coming from there.

54
00:04:48,671 --> 00:04:49,949
I am sure.

55
00:04:50,029 --> 00:04:52,312
Look there. Can't you see?

56
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:15,304
Hey, Zakir! You do not
belong here...

57
00:05:15,384 --> 00:05:19,448
Yet you are trying
to dominate in our area?

58
00:05:19,987 --> 00:05:21,730
Silly fellow!

59
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:26,363
You can get out of
here only when I decide.

60
00:06:08,609 --> 00:06:12,655
Buddy, don't mess with us.

61
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:15,424
All of us are tigers here.

62
00:06:15,504 --> 00:06:17,572
No one can enter this place...

63
00:06:17,652 --> 00:06:21,233
If someone does
enter... he cannot go out.

64
00:07:40,474 --> 00:07:42,334
They are leading their lives.

65
00:07:42,414 --> 00:07:44,272
Why are you troubling
them off and on?

66
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:46,951
That place is their only possession.

67
00:07:47,031 --> 00:07:49,415
If you grab that from them,
where will they go?

68
00:07:51,657 --> 00:07:54,957
Zakir, do you need only
that land for construction?

69
00:07:55,037 --> 00:07:56,408
Doctor...
- Keep your advice to yourself.

70
00:07:57,128 --> 00:07:58,375
May I come in?

71
00:08:00,027 --> 00:08:03,991
A doctor should only
treat his patients...

72
00:08:04,071 --> 00:08:06,324
And not give unsolicited advice.

73
00:08:06,404 --> 00:08:10,103
Show off to your nurse. Yes.

74
00:08:10,668 --> 00:08:11,748
Let us go out.

75
00:08:17,404 --> 00:08:19,946
You should always achieve your aim.

76
00:08:20,365 --> 00:08:22,424
Not get beaten!

77
00:08:24,122 --> 00:08:25,169
Never mind.

78
00:08:26,033 --> 00:08:27,727
Boss will be here in a month.

79
00:08:27,807 --> 00:08:29,287
Let us keep quiet till then.

80
00:08:29,367 --> 00:08:32,944
When he comes,
we will handle the people,

81
00:08:33,024 --> 00:08:37,750
in the slum and force
them to vacate it.

82
00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:41,183
People come to us to collect
money to celebrate Kannada,

83
00:08:41,263 --> 00:08:43,200
'Rajyotsava' or Ganesha festival...

84
00:08:43,516 --> 00:08:49,809
But Ram approached me to conduct
a health check-up for everyone here.

85
00:08:49,889 --> 00:08:52,091
Please come for the health check-up.

86
00:08:52,171 --> 00:08:55,589
We will try our level best to serve
you and cure your health problems.

87
00:08:56,705 --> 00:08:58,036
I do not deserve the applause.

88
00:08:58,116 --> 00:08:59,178
Please come.
- No, sir.

89
00:08:59,258 --> 00:09:01,091
Clap for our Ram.

90
00:09:01,171 --> 00:09:02,956
Ram is the person
responsible for this.

91
00:09:03,036 --> 00:09:04,460
I have arranged everything inside.
- Okay, sir.

92
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:05,481
Send them.
- Okay.

93
00:09:05,561 --> 00:09:06,874
Come.
- Okay, sir.

94
00:09:17,246 --> 00:09:19,243
Has he picked up the call?
- No, sir.

95
00:09:19,323 --> 00:09:20,956
Bashir!
- Yes, boss.

96
00:09:21,036 --> 00:09:24,653
I am in trouble.
Where is Ram? I am feeling tense.

97
00:09:24,733 --> 00:09:25,743
You are his boss.
If you do not know,

98
00:09:25,823 --> 00:09:27,261
then how will I?
- Oh, God!

99
00:09:27,341 --> 00:09:31,287
He comes and goes at will.

100
00:09:31,367 --> 00:09:35,543
It is the month end.
And he has not achieved his target.

101
00:09:35,623 --> 00:09:38,964
My insurance company will suffer
losses if this continues.

102
00:09:39,044 --> 00:09:40,109
Close it down.

103
00:09:40,189 --> 00:09:41,116
Close it.
- Sir!

104
00:09:41,196 --> 00:09:42,250
Close it.

105
00:09:46,109 --> 00:09:47,209
Buddy!

106
00:09:47,289 --> 00:09:49,971
Get up.
- No, I will not.

107
00:09:50,051 --> 00:09:51,703
Death.
- What?

108
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:53,487
Death!

109
00:10:03,409 --> 00:10:05,130
You look smart.

110
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:07,029
You must have been
a doctor or an engineer?

111
00:10:07,109 --> 00:10:09,416
I missed it and ended
up being an insurance agent.

112
00:10:09,827 --> 00:10:12,041
You are right, mother.
Had I not failed,

113
00:10:12,121 --> 00:10:14,665
in six subjects in grade twelve,
I would have become...

114
00:10:15,466 --> 00:10:16,613
I just missed...

115
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:18,516
Just missed?

116
00:10:18,596 --> 00:10:19,975
Okay, do not feel bad. Bye.
- Ready!

117
00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:30,310
You are the only one who has come
to a funeral fully dressed.

118
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:32,746
Never mind. Is everything ready?

119
00:10:32,826 --> 00:10:35,706
Yes, everything is ready.
I am only waiting for your performance.

120
00:10:35,786 --> 00:10:39,365
Just wait and watch my performance.

121
00:10:40,451 --> 00:10:41,953
What is the name of the candidate?

122
00:10:42,033 --> 00:10:43,866
Ramesh Mukherji.

123
00:10:43,946 --> 00:10:45,322
Rummy?
- Yes.

124
00:10:45,516 --> 00:10:46,477
Right!

125
00:10:46,953 --> 00:10:50,121
Rummy!

126
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:52,794
Rummy!

127
00:10:55,034 --> 00:10:57,138
Rummy!

128
00:10:58,214 --> 00:11:01,462
Rummy! Rummy!

129
00:11:01,998 --> 00:11:03,054
Rummy...

130
00:11:04,486 --> 00:11:09,015
We became friends
while playing Rummy.

131
00:11:10,422 --> 00:11:13,525
Rummy, I feel sorry
about your death.

132
00:11:14,537 --> 00:11:18,036
We have become 'dummy' without you.

133
00:11:18,116 --> 00:11:19,643
Dummy!

134
00:11:22,286 --> 00:11:23,774
Where is mother, sir?

135
00:11:25,193 --> 00:11:27,963
Mother...

136
00:11:28,043 --> 00:11:30,095
Mother...

137
00:11:31,314 --> 00:11:34,754
Do not cry. I am there for you.

138
00:11:34,834 --> 00:11:37,991
He was ready to
sign the application.

139
00:11:38,299 --> 00:11:42,609
The application is here...
But Rummy is not alive to sign it.

140
00:11:42,689 --> 00:11:43,712
How is it?

141
00:11:44,444 --> 00:11:47,726
Had he signed
today and died tomorrow,

142
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:51,199
you would have got
the insurance money.

143
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:52,554
How much, sir?

144
00:11:52,634 --> 00:11:54,595
Fifty million rupees.

145
00:11:54,675 --> 00:11:56,646
Father!

146
00:11:56,726 --> 00:11:58,047
My, dear!

147
00:11:58,127 --> 00:11:59,990
Father-in-law!
- Father!

148
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:01,473
Grandpa,

149
00:12:01,553 --> 00:12:06,837
you wanted to take a policy
for fifty million rupees for us?

150
00:12:07,053 --> 00:12:11,183
Mother! Mother,
we have lost fifty million rupees.

151
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:14,109
Why did you leave
us and go away so soon?

152
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:19,028
Oh, God! Why did you
take him away so soon?

153
00:12:19,276 --> 00:12:23,300
Aunt, please do not cry.
Do not cry.

154
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,106
Sir!
- Yes.

155
00:12:25,186 --> 00:12:27,774
Is he your son?
- Yes, sir.

156
00:12:30,665 --> 00:12:32,754
'He is dead. Chotu is eating chips.'

157
00:12:34,755 --> 00:12:35,983
My son must cry.

158
00:12:36,235 --> 00:12:37,287
My son must cry.

159
00:12:37,814 --> 00:12:40,312
My son must cry after my death.

160
00:12:40,392 --> 00:12:42,428
I will take an insurance
policy for a hundred million rupees.

161
00:12:42,508 --> 00:12:44,851
You come tomorrow.
- Why should you wait till tomorrow?

162
00:12:44,931 --> 00:12:47,419
Take the policy today
with your father's blessings.

163
00:12:47,499 --> 00:12:49,581
Madam, what do you say?
- Yes, son.

164
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:53,249
Why tomorrow? He is right.

165
00:12:53,329 --> 00:12:54,710
Take the policy today.

166
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:56,517
Yes brother, take it today.

167
00:12:56,597 --> 00:12:57,451
Do it now.

168
00:12:57,531 --> 00:12:59,018
I will buy the policy
for the sake of my child.

169
00:12:59,098 --> 00:13:00,060
I will also take a policy.

170
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:00,956
Even I will buy one.

171
00:13:01,036 --> 00:13:02,175
Even I will...
- I will also take...

172
00:13:02,255 --> 00:13:04,636
I will also take.
- I will also take.

173
00:13:04,716 --> 00:13:05,568
I will also take.
- Thank you.

174
00:13:05,648 --> 00:13:08,408
Hail, Ramesh Mukherji!

175
00:13:08,488 --> 00:13:11,079
Hail Ramesh Mukherji!

176
00:13:11,554 --> 00:13:15,750
You are smart. You do the
entire month's work in a day.

177
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:18,394
I do not work during the month.

178
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,175
I work only for a day in a month...

179
00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:24,836
Move.

180
00:13:45,774 --> 00:13:47,584
Who is she, buddy?

181
00:13:47,664 --> 00:13:50,633
She is the friend of
the dead man's daughter.

182
00:13:51,837 --> 00:13:53,271
She is so emotional,

183
00:13:53,351 --> 00:13:55,263
and is crying so much for
her friend's father.

184
00:13:55,343 --> 00:13:57,933
Imagine how she will
be if her own father dies?

185
00:13:58,881 --> 00:13:59,856
You...

186
00:14:10,253 --> 00:14:12,282
Fool, do you know how
many months have passed,

187
00:14:12,362 --> 00:14:13,636
since we started our company?

188
00:14:13,716 --> 00:14:15,662
None of you have reached the target.

189
00:14:15,742 --> 00:14:19,188
Targets should increase,
not your hair.

190
00:14:19,268 --> 00:14:21,696
You fool! If this continues,

191
00:14:21,776 --> 00:14:25,536
I will have to fake my death
and claim insurance money.

192
00:14:26,295 --> 00:14:27,876
Hi, Ram. You look handsome.

193
00:14:27,956 --> 00:14:30,356
Thank you. - Ram, you said
we would go on a date today?

194
00:14:30,436 --> 00:14:31,604
I will come with you, baby.

195
00:14:33,252 --> 00:14:35,054
Buddy!
- Yes, boss.

196
00:14:35,134 --> 00:14:37,391
It is the end of the month but none
of us have achieved the target.

197
00:14:37,471 --> 00:14:38,808
Still... The company is open.

198
00:14:39,261 --> 00:14:40,602
Shut down shop!

199
00:14:40,682 --> 00:14:44,755
Ram!
- Greetings to all of you.

200
00:14:44,835 --> 00:14:46,147
Hi!
- Hi, brother!

201
00:14:46,813 --> 00:14:49,094
How do I scold him
to make him feel guilty?

202
00:14:49,174 --> 00:14:51,266
He will feel guilty if you die.
- What do you mean?

203
00:14:51,346 --> 00:14:52,717
Sir, please take the application.

204
00:14:52,797 --> 00:14:54,529
What about Ram's target?

205
00:14:54,609 --> 00:14:56,990
The monthly target is Twenty.
80 more. So, the total is...

206
00:14:57,070 --> 00:14:58,457
Hundred. Wow!
- Yes.

207
00:14:58,537 --> 00:15:02,000
Give me the commission. I'll
not come back till the end of the month.

208
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:03,387
Bye, baby.
- Bye.

209
00:15:03,467 --> 00:15:05,609
Ram, you are my beautiful heart.

210
00:15:07,128 --> 00:15:08,567
The bill amount is forty
thousand rupees.

211
00:15:08,647 --> 00:15:10,597
Pay and then take your wife.

212
00:15:11,841 --> 00:15:14,934
She just fainted.

213
00:15:15,503 --> 00:15:17,381
Why are you charging
so high for that?

214
00:15:17,461 --> 00:15:19,861
What? Only fainted!

215
00:15:19,941 --> 00:15:24,219
Her BP shot up, sugar level dropped
and she was in the ICU for two days.

216
00:15:24,299 --> 00:15:27,480
You beg us to save
the patient during admission,

217
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:29,828
but create a
fuss during the discharge process.

218
00:15:29,908 --> 00:15:32,838
I cannot pay, sir.
I only have twenty thousand rupees.

219
00:15:32,918 --> 00:15:36,097
Why do you come to multi-speciality
hospitals if you have no money?

220
00:15:36,373 --> 00:15:38,052
There are many government hospitals.

221
00:15:38,132 --> 00:15:40,174
Go there and die.
- Shut up.

222
00:15:40,764 --> 00:15:42,048
Mind your words.

223
00:15:42,843 --> 00:15:45,619
Is this the way to treat
those come to our hospital?

224
00:15:45,699 --> 00:15:47,305
He is saying he has
twenty thousand rupees.

225
00:15:47,385 --> 00:15:49,179
Take it and discharge his wife.

226
00:15:49,994 --> 00:15:53,587
Diseases do not differentiate
between rich and poor people.

227
00:15:53,865 --> 00:15:55,208
Doctors treat everyone
in the same way.

228
00:15:56,902 --> 00:15:58,255
Let us charge those
who can afford it.

229
00:15:58,632 --> 00:16:01,126
And do our bit for the needy.

230
00:16:01,523 --> 00:16:02,565
Look!
- Yes, sir.

231
00:16:02,645 --> 00:16:05,037
Collect whatever money
he has and discharge the patient.

232
00:16:05,117 --> 00:16:06,278
Sure, sir.

233
00:16:06,358 --> 00:16:07,358
And you...

234
00:16:07,791 --> 00:16:09,211
Get out of my hospital.
- Sir!

235
00:16:09,291 --> 00:16:10,243
Get out.

236
00:16:11,532 --> 00:16:12,549
Sir...

237
00:16:20,293 --> 00:16:24,546
Ram, what is the reason for
coming here early in the morning?

238
00:16:24,774 --> 00:16:27,137
Sir, please take
an insurance policy.

239
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:32,655
Are you an insurance agent
or the owner of that company?

240
00:16:32,735 --> 00:16:33,536
That...

241
00:16:33,616 --> 00:16:36,370
You have forced us to take two life,

242
00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:38,589
health insurance
policies for me, my wife,

243
00:16:38,669 --> 00:16:40,961
my children and my housekeepers.

244
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:44,519
Look, he is the
only person left out.

245
00:16:44,786 --> 00:16:47,082
He joined only day before.

246
00:16:47,701 --> 00:16:49,657
Yes. Let me take one
insurance policy for him also.

247
00:16:50,774 --> 00:16:54,460
Give your passport size photo and
Aadhar card to him. - Alright, sir.

248
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:56,658
He will take an insurance
policy for you also.

249
00:16:56,738 --> 00:16:57,584
Okay...

250
00:16:58,466 --> 00:17:00,461
Sir...
- Yes.

251
00:17:00,977 --> 00:17:03,610
I was referring to
the people in our area.

252
00:17:04,086 --> 00:17:06,526
Poor people.
They have no money for treatment.

253
00:17:08,633 --> 00:17:12,880
The old man was struggling yesterday
to pay the hospital bill.

254
00:17:13,550 --> 00:17:17,559
Since it was Hariprasad's hospital,
he helped him.

255
00:17:18,213 --> 00:17:20,404
How much can he also do?

256
00:17:20,813 --> 00:17:25,452
It will be better if our
people here have some insurance.

257
00:17:25,532 --> 00:17:26,915
Our people!

258
00:17:31,406 --> 00:17:34,136
The people here revere me a lot.

259
00:17:34,932 --> 00:17:36,862
Whatever I have done for them
is less compared to that.

260
00:17:38,271 --> 00:17:41,265
Do not worry. We will do it.

261
00:17:41,764 --> 00:17:42,770
Okay.

262
00:17:43,318 --> 00:17:47,431
Sir, Gopal, sir is calling.

263
00:17:47,511 --> 00:17:48,684
Greetings, sir.

264
00:17:48,955 --> 00:17:49,973
Tell me, Gopal, sir.

265
00:17:50,518 --> 00:17:53,170
I am coming to your
area today for an election campaign.

266
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:55,455
It will be good for me
if you join me.

267
00:17:55,879 --> 00:17:58,086
Okay.
- Thank you...

268
00:17:59,812 --> 00:18:03,375
I have decided to support Gopalan,

269
00:18:03,455 --> 00:18:06,237
during the ensuing
corporation election.

270
00:18:06,819 --> 00:18:08,066
What is your opinion?

271
00:18:08,146 --> 00:18:10,793
We come to you for all our problems.

272
00:18:10,873 --> 00:18:12,662
Raja, sir, we will not disobey you.

273
00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:15,029
Sir, why are you begging for votes?

274
00:18:15,109 --> 00:18:17,352
You are educating the
children of this area.

275
00:18:17,432 --> 00:18:19,990
We are happy about it.
You have a good heart.

276
00:18:20,546 --> 00:18:23,574
We will vote for
the person who you propose.

277
00:18:23,914 --> 00:18:26,007
What do you say?
- Of course.

278
00:18:26,087 --> 00:18:30,461
Just say one word. We will do it.

279
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:34,643
Shut up. Everything did
not happen because of me.

280
00:18:35,371 --> 00:18:38,151
Now Gopalan, sir will speak.

281
00:18:39,881 --> 00:18:41,304
Greetings to all of you.

282
00:18:41,822 --> 00:18:43,797
I am pleased to see you all.

283
00:18:44,433 --> 00:18:49,823
You believe in Raja sir.
Raja sir believes in me.

284
00:18:50,025 --> 00:18:51,548
I will keep up both.

285
00:18:51,829 --> 00:18:56,294
Please vote for me and
give me a chance to serve you.

286
00:18:56,374 --> 00:18:58,924
I assure you that I will make
insurance policies for all of you.

287
00:18:59,004 --> 00:19:00,728
Thank you, sir.
- That is good.

288
00:19:00,808 --> 00:19:02,619
Okay.
- Do not feel,

289
00:19:03,282 --> 00:19:05,983
that I am paying it
as bribe to buy your votes.

290
00:19:06,063 --> 00:19:08,212
It is your right to cast a vote.

291
00:19:08,292 --> 00:19:10,317
Serving you is my duty.

292
00:19:10,661 --> 00:19:11,571
Greetings.

293
00:19:19,925 --> 00:19:22,250
The persons who had fought
in our area the other day,

294
00:19:23,083 --> 00:19:25,222
work for Badrinarayan constructions.

295
00:19:25,302 --> 00:19:28,361
They are not ordinary people
who came here to create a stir.

296
00:19:28,441 --> 00:19:33,355
Once they find an area, they
will not stop till they acquire it.

297
00:19:33,435 --> 00:19:35,698
Big shots support them.
That is the reason.

298
00:19:37,329 --> 00:19:39,858
That's why I will handle it.

299
00:19:40,687 --> 00:19:42,040
You remain quiet.

300
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:47,641
Sir, I will fight and drive out
those who want to capture our area.

301
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:49,532
I will not give up our place.

302
00:19:49,612 --> 00:19:54,585
Ram, that is why I am asking
you to cool down.

303
00:19:54,892 --> 00:19:56,162
But you do not listen to me.

304
00:19:58,094 --> 00:20:00,917
My dear boys and girls...

305
00:20:01,281 --> 00:20:04,402
Your target should not start
at the end of the month, like Ram.

306
00:20:04,482 --> 00:20:06,771
You should start at
the beginning of the month...

307
00:20:06,851 --> 00:20:10,548
And take my company
to great heights.

308
00:20:10,628 --> 00:20:12,643
Boys and girls...
- Yes, sir.

309
00:20:12,723 --> 00:20:14,090
Very good.
- Hi, Ram!

310
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:16,496
He usually comes
at the end of the month.

311
00:20:16,576 --> 00:20:19,278
How come he has come
at the beginning? Why?

312
00:20:22,562 --> 00:20:23,851
Ram!

313
00:20:23,931 --> 00:20:25,070
What is this?

314
00:20:25,150 --> 00:20:29,349
You have reached the target fixed
for all of them single-handedly?

315
00:20:29,637 --> 00:20:31,106
Useless fellows!

316
00:20:31,186 --> 00:20:32,002
Do you think,

317
00:20:32,082 --> 00:20:34,751
I have come at the beginning
of the month for my commission?

318
00:20:35,934 --> 00:20:37,891
No. I have come for the
sake of the people in my area.

319
00:20:37,971 --> 00:20:40,480
How do you feel about the
care that I take for my people?

320
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:43,420
Boss, no comments. Only likes.

321
00:20:44,207 --> 00:20:45,726
Application and soon confirmation.

322
00:20:45,806 --> 00:20:47,747
Cab coming to area.
- What?

323
00:20:47,827 --> 00:20:49,487
Can't you understand English
despite being a Kannadiga?

324
00:20:49,567 --> 00:20:52,352
Process these applications
soon and fix a health camp.

325
00:20:52,432 --> 00:20:53,351
Okay, boss?
- Yes.

326
00:20:53,431 --> 00:20:54,436
Bye.

327
00:20:56,911 --> 00:20:58,231
Sir, excuse me.

328
00:20:58,311 --> 00:21:01,353
This is my pet dog Chintu.
It is missing. Did you see it?

329
00:21:01,433 --> 00:21:02,526
No. I have not seen it anywhere.

330
00:21:02,606 --> 00:21:05,369
Sir, this is my dog Chintu.
Have you seen it anywhere?

331
00:21:05,449 --> 00:21:07,294
Do you think I have no other work?
Get lost.

332
00:21:07,665 --> 00:21:09,680
I am worried because
my dog is missing.

333
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:12,072
Do not bother me.
- Sir, have you seen this puppy?

334
00:21:12,152 --> 00:21:13,312
No. Sorry.

335
00:21:13,392 --> 00:21:15,222
Who is this girl roaming,

336
00:21:15,302 --> 00:21:18,574
about enquiring about her puppy
early in the morning?

337
00:21:27,311 --> 00:21:28,454
Buddy!

338
00:21:38,542 --> 00:21:39,764
Hello, madam!

339
00:21:40,462 --> 00:21:44,327
You meant 'puppy'? I thought
it was a chicken. Come here.

340
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:46,939
I love puppies.
Is it a male or female puppy?

341
00:21:47,019 --> 00:21:47,820
Right?
- Yes...

342
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:50,146
How long is it since
it went missing?

343
00:21:50,226 --> 00:21:52,089
It has been five minutes.
- Five minutes!

344
00:21:52,169 --> 00:21:53,519
Only five minutes?

345
00:21:53,599 --> 00:21:55,171
You just keep quiet.

346
00:21:56,325 --> 00:21:57,126
It has been five long minutes.

347
00:21:57,206 --> 00:22:00,350
It must be hungry.
It might not have taken food.

348
00:22:00,430 --> 00:22:03,458
Hop on. Let us search.
- Start the bike.

349
00:22:06,259 --> 00:22:08,010
You go left.
You right. You straight.

350
00:22:08,090 --> 00:22:08,968
Buddy, you stay here.

351
00:22:09,048 --> 00:22:10,212
Madam, may I know your name, please?
- Khushi.

352
00:22:10,292 --> 00:22:11,828
Whose number is on the pamphlet?
- Mother.

353
00:22:12,166 --> 00:22:13,362
Take Khushi madam's number.

354
00:22:13,442 --> 00:22:15,689
Call us as soon as you
find Chintukumari. Right? - Yes.

355
00:22:15,769 --> 00:22:17,477
You will be with her.
We will call you.

356
00:22:17,557 --> 00:22:19,673
No. Call me as soon
as you find Chintukumari.

357
00:22:19,753 --> 00:22:21,589
We will call you as
soon as we find the puppy.

358
00:22:21,669 --> 00:22:23,190
Shut up.
- It is my bad time!

359
00:22:23,270 --> 00:22:25,315
My phone would have stopped.
- Yes...

360
00:22:25,395 --> 00:22:27,044
Who will you call then?

361
00:22:29,168 --> 00:22:31,003
I understood, you naughty boy.

362
00:22:31,325 --> 00:22:34,195
9742358...

363
00:22:36,015 --> 00:22:38,331
Hello! What is the matter, mother?

364
00:22:40,432 --> 00:22:41,767
Is it?

365
00:22:41,847 --> 00:22:43,641
Alright, I will come.

366
00:22:44,116 --> 00:22:47,578
Sir, Chintumari was
sleeping under the cot.

367
00:22:47,658 --> 00:22:49,207
Found her. See you.

368
00:22:49,532 --> 00:22:50,602
Thank you.
- Ram...

369
00:22:50,682 --> 00:22:52,483
Ram, thank you so much.

370
00:22:52,674 --> 00:22:53,560
Madam!
- Yes?

371
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:54,902
It has been only five minutes
since the puppy went missing.

372
00:22:54,982 --> 00:22:56,284
Have you printed
the pamphlet so fast?

373
00:22:56,486 --> 00:22:57,425
Why are you bothered about it?
- Bye.

374
00:22:57,744 --> 00:22:58,810
Bye.

375
00:22:58,890 --> 00:23:00,482
It is her wish to print
a pamphlet or erect a tent.

376
00:23:00,562 --> 00:23:02,144
Why are you bothered?
I told you to take her number.

377
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:04,939
Collect details about
her and report to me.

378
00:23:05,019 --> 00:23:06,399
Okay, boss. Okay.
- Okay?

379
00:23:06,479 --> 00:23:07,331
Yes.

380
00:23:07,883 --> 00:23:09,955
We have collected her details.

381
00:23:10,035 --> 00:23:11,157
Her name is Khushi.

382
00:23:11,237 --> 00:23:13,122
She wants to be always happy.

383
00:23:13,202 --> 00:23:14,519
She has studied law.

384
00:23:14,599 --> 00:23:16,177
She does not care for anyone.

385
00:23:16,257 --> 00:23:18,599
But she will never become a lawyer.

386
00:23:19,491 --> 00:23:20,897
Move. Move.

387
00:23:21,164 --> 00:23:22,224
Thank God!

388
00:23:22,304 --> 00:23:24,094
What happened? Have you passed?

389
00:23:24,174 --> 00:23:26,207
No. Failed in two
subjects this time.

390
00:23:26,287 --> 00:23:28,238
Ten subjects in total.

391
00:23:28,318 --> 00:23:31,737
I will clear all backlog
in one stroke. - Oh, God!

392
00:23:31,817 --> 00:23:33,416
When the cable operator
asked for money,

393
00:23:33,496 --> 00:23:34,557
she threatened to
file a case against him.

394
00:23:34,637 --> 00:23:36,024
If you have any doubts,
look at the flashback.

395
00:23:36,104 --> 00:23:38,876
As per IPC 497/420,

396
00:23:38,956 --> 00:23:41,261
the husband will be
jailed for five years

397
00:23:41,341 --> 00:23:45,250
If he cheats his wife
and has illicit relationships.

398
00:23:49,164 --> 00:23:52,902
Nice to hear it. Tell your husband
after marriage about this.

399
00:23:52,982 --> 00:23:54,977
Now pay me my dues.

400
00:23:55,057 --> 00:23:56,270
I will give. I will give.

401
00:23:56,350 --> 00:23:59,692
But if I give this to your wife,

402
00:23:59,772 --> 00:24:01,300
she will know that you were,

403
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:05,652
spending time in Mala aunt's
house between 9.30 and 10.30 pm,

404
00:24:05,732 --> 00:24:07,498
under the pretext of
collecting the amount.

405
00:24:08,393 --> 00:24:10,924
According to the law the collection
has been misused by the collector.

406
00:24:11,004 --> 00:24:13,276
So, your collection is overruled.
That's all, your honour.

407
00:24:15,171 --> 00:24:16,854
Bill...
- You need not pay, madam.

408
00:24:16,934 --> 00:24:20,497
You will get a free
connection for the entire year.

409
00:24:20,577 --> 00:24:21,681
That's good.

410
00:24:22,852 --> 00:24:25,603
I was asked to pay
the price of ten cows for one cow.

411
00:24:25,683 --> 00:24:28,265
I made the mistake of
supplying milk to her house.

412
00:24:28,345 --> 00:24:31,165
So, I have
one cow where I had ten.

413
00:24:31,422 --> 00:24:34,052
Mostly that cow is also dead.

414
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:37,326
According to the law, IPC 420 of
the food adulteration law,

415
00:24:37,406 --> 00:24:39,894
you will go to jail
if I file a case against you.

416
00:24:39,974 --> 00:24:42,778
It will take
five years for you to come out,

417
00:24:42,858 --> 00:24:45,882
because the lawyer
who will fight the case is me.

418
00:24:45,962 --> 00:24:48,577
Will I go to jail
for adding water to milk?

419
00:24:48,657 --> 00:24:50,165
If I have to pardon you,

420
00:24:50,245 --> 00:24:55,221
you must bring the cow here
daily and milk it before me.

421
00:24:55,301 --> 00:24:56,448
Cow!

422
00:25:00,270 --> 00:25:01,740
It has no standard degree.

423
00:25:03,705 --> 00:25:05,658
Mostly it has less protein.

424
00:25:05,738 --> 00:25:09,328
From now do not give normal
Horlicks. Give booster Horlicks.

425
00:25:09,408 --> 00:25:10,888
Booster Horlicks!

426
00:25:11,849 --> 00:25:14,045
Today the fat content is more.

427
00:25:14,125 --> 00:25:17,511
Take her for a walk for an
hour tomorrow before coming here.

428
00:25:17,591 --> 00:25:20,779
Oh, God! Walk!

429
00:25:21,097 --> 00:25:24,842
We will fix her.

430
00:25:24,922 --> 00:25:26,897
Let us make a plan.

431
00:25:26,977 --> 00:25:28,612
We will ask Peter.
- Come on.

432
00:25:29,019 --> 00:25:30,666
Peter! Peter!
- Peter!

433
00:25:30,746 --> 00:25:32,840
I heard your voice. I heard it.

434
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:35,059
It smells good!

435
00:25:35,139 --> 00:25:37,935
We can smell it from
a long distance. - Keep quiet.

436
00:25:38,015 --> 00:25:38,821
Peter!
- Yes?

437
00:25:38,901 --> 00:25:40,650
Look here.
Both the arrows are together.

438
00:25:41,255 --> 00:25:42,100
Keep it there.

439
00:25:42,524 --> 00:25:44,217
That is my wife's first gift to me.

440
00:25:44,438 --> 00:25:45,320
Keep it there.

441
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:46,855
Your wife has left you. What
is the use of keeping this watch?

442
00:25:46,935 --> 00:25:48,003
Are you a watchman?

443
00:25:48,418 --> 00:25:50,440
Keep the watch.
- Do not speak about my wife.

444
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:52,669
Peter that is not the matter.
- Okay...

445
00:25:52,749 --> 00:25:55,162
I saw a girl, Peter.

446
00:25:55,242 --> 00:25:57,766
She is very beautiful, Peter.

447
00:25:57,846 --> 00:26:00,043
Do not fall for looks.

448
00:26:00,123 --> 00:26:02,474
Only one person built
the Taj Mahal for a beauty.

449
00:26:02,554 --> 00:26:05,413
All others lost.

450
00:26:05,493 --> 00:26:06,349
Look!

451
00:26:07,327 --> 00:26:10,931
If I have to share
my experience, love...

452
00:26:11,011 --> 00:26:12,547
Peter! The matter is serious.

453
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:14,628
Serious...
- Do something.

454
00:26:14,708 --> 00:26:17,792
Give me a plan to flirt with her.
- Right!

455
00:26:17,872 --> 00:26:19,589
What is her name?
- Khushi.

456
00:26:19,669 --> 00:26:21,724
What is she studying?
- LLB.

457
00:26:21,971 --> 00:26:25,478
What does she like?
- Dogs.

458
00:26:25,558 --> 00:26:27,276
Shut up!
- Dog?

459
00:26:27,356 --> 00:26:29,159
Yes.
- Oh, God!

460
00:26:32,414 --> 00:26:34,404
Give me that tomato.
- Tomato!

461
00:26:36,284 --> 00:26:37,764
Give me the onion.
- Onion!

462
00:26:40,491 --> 00:26:42,517
It increases the strength.

463
00:26:42,597 --> 00:26:43,554
Now all of you come.

464
00:26:47,464 --> 00:26:49,363
Come on...

465
00:26:51,375 --> 00:26:52,918
It is smoking.

466
00:26:53,604 --> 00:26:55,531
Do you like this.

467
00:26:56,278 --> 00:26:58,404
Wow!
- Thank God!

468
00:27:03,165 --> 00:27:05,127
So, nice! Beautiful!

469
00:27:05,311 --> 00:27:10,603
Thank God!
Dear, my love, how are you?

470
00:27:10,683 --> 00:27:11,632
Ram!

471
00:27:11,712 --> 00:27:13,641
How do you know my name?

472
00:27:14,129 --> 00:27:16,775
Ram, I called you.

473
00:27:18,084 --> 00:27:20,377
Khushi! What a pleasant surprise!

474
00:27:20,457 --> 00:27:21,591
This is my house.

475
00:27:23,030 --> 00:27:25,014
How come you are here?
- I was passing by...

476
00:27:25,094 --> 00:27:28,091
Saw him.
I thought of my pet dog Kariya.

477
00:27:28,591 --> 00:27:29,786
So, I spoke to him.

478
00:27:30,091 --> 00:27:31,101
Kariya?

479
00:27:31,181 --> 00:27:32,504
I have many things to say about him.

480
00:27:33,387 --> 00:27:36,500
One day Kariya left me.

481
00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:39,656
I looked everywhere
and enquired with everyone.

482
00:27:40,674 --> 00:27:43,497
I look in different areas every day,

483
00:27:43,577 --> 00:27:44,964
in the hope that
I will find him.

484
00:27:45,501 --> 00:27:49,398
Today I was in
your area and I met you.

485
00:27:50,164 --> 00:27:51,665
What happened to Kariya after that?

486
00:27:51,745 --> 00:27:54,950
I could not find Kariya anywhere.

487
00:27:55,234 --> 00:27:59,436
But I did not stop
searching for him.

488
00:27:59,874 --> 00:28:01,915
Whenever I looked
in different areas,

489
00:28:02,269 --> 00:28:04,794
I found orphaned dogs like Kariya.

490
00:28:05,374 --> 00:28:06,290
Then I decided,

491
00:28:06,888 --> 00:28:09,491
to be a father to them
and started the 'Bhow' 'Bhow' ashram.

492
00:28:10,542 --> 00:28:12,245
I am there as their father.

493
00:28:13,263 --> 00:28:15,658
But there is no one
to take the mother's place.

494
00:28:16,156 --> 00:28:18,476
Oh, God! Why is this happening?

495
00:28:20,911 --> 00:28:21,987
Ram!

496
00:28:25,696 --> 00:28:28,615
I am there, Ram.
I will take the mother's place.

497
00:28:28,817 --> 00:28:29,880
Is it?

498
00:28:31,097 --> 00:28:33,183
Oh, God! Now I believe
that you are there.

499
00:28:34,008 --> 00:28:35,761
She has fallen into my trap so easily!

500
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:38,808
Nothing, Khushi.

501
00:28:38,888 --> 00:28:40,240
As long as there
is a mother like you,

502
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,215
no dog will be an orphan.

503
00:28:42,295 --> 00:28:44,195
No dog will be an orphan.

504
00:28:44,275 --> 00:28:46,246
Kariya, come here.
- Ram!

505
00:28:47,494 --> 00:28:50,992
It is my neighbour's dog.
It has parents.

506
00:28:51,072 --> 00:28:52,693
Yes.
- So, lucky!

507
00:28:53,135 --> 00:28:54,194
So, lucky!

508
00:28:55,673 --> 00:28:57,929
Tomorrow I will come
to your 'Bhow' ashram.

509
00:28:58,215 --> 00:28:59,781
I will bring Chintu along with me.

510
00:28:59,861 --> 00:29:01,480
To my 'Bhow' ashram?
- Yes.

511
00:29:01,817 --> 00:29:02,904
BOW BOW ASHRAM
ALWAYS AT YOUR SERVICE

512
00:29:04,053 --> 00:29:04,853
BOW BOW ASHRAM
DOG SHELTER HOUSE

513
00:29:04,933 --> 00:29:07,867
I have never seen such
a beautiful ashram anywhere.

514
00:29:07,947 --> 00:29:08,986
What is there to see?

515
00:29:09,691 --> 00:29:11,519
Nothing.
Come. I will show you the ashram.

516
00:29:11,599 --> 00:29:12,524
Move aside.

517
00:29:14,383 --> 00:29:18,571
Business is my profession
but service is my passion.

518
00:29:18,651 --> 00:29:21,108
By the way,
this is our service vehicle.

519
00:29:21,188 --> 00:29:22,561
'Bhow Bhow' ambulance.

520
00:29:22,641 --> 00:29:25,927
Whenever any dog barks, we bring it,

521
00:29:26,007 --> 00:29:30,489
to this vehicle out
of love and treat it here.

522
00:29:34,143 --> 00:29:38,292
Actually, the doctor slept here
because he treated till late night.

523
00:29:38,372 --> 00:29:39,680
Isn't it?
- Yes.

524
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:41,177
Okay...
- It is morning time.

525
00:29:41,257 --> 00:29:42,308
Yes. Yes.
- I never realized.

526
00:29:43,508 --> 00:29:47,900
Sir, Ramesh got pig fever.
So, I cut the pig and joined it.

527
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:52,600
If anyone gets a chicken fever, I will
skin it out and treat it like this.

528
00:29:53,582 --> 00:29:55,806
Who is he? - He is Manja,
works at the mutton shop.

529
00:29:56,193 --> 00:29:59,357
Ramesh...
- Ramesh is our dog's name.

530
00:29:59,642 --> 00:30:01,295
We give our human names to the dogs,

531
00:30:01,375 --> 00:30:03,084
and vice versa for therapy.

532
00:30:03,164 --> 00:30:06,187
That is what he is saying.
- Okay.

533
00:30:06,267 --> 00:30:07,088
Isn't it?
- Yes.

534
00:30:07,168 --> 00:30:08,150
Yes.
- Okay...

535
00:30:08,230 --> 00:30:11,672
But he spoke about
'pig' 'chicken' etc.. - That...

536
00:30:11,752 --> 00:30:15,771
He is saying,
he cured Ramesh of pig fever.

537
00:30:15,851 --> 00:30:20,823
If he gets a chicken fever
he will cure him in the same way.

538
00:30:20,903 --> 00:30:23,433
That... Actually, meet Doctor Jimmy.

539
00:30:23,513 --> 00:30:25,889
Hi! I am Jimmy.
- Go away.

540
00:30:25,969 --> 00:30:27,005
Look there.

541
00:30:27,535 --> 00:30:31,221
Germans gave this award
when we rescued a German shepherd.

542
00:30:31,301 --> 00:30:34,076
Award!
- Yes, an international award.

543
00:30:34,301 --> 00:30:36,336
'Trees are needed for our life.'

544
00:30:36,416 --> 00:30:38,783
'Dogs need flesh.'

545
00:30:39,035 --> 00:30:39,914
Wow!

546
00:30:40,266 --> 00:30:43,063
A small poem to inspire the dogs.
- Basha!

547
00:30:43,494 --> 00:30:44,440
Basha!

548
00:30:45,237 --> 00:30:46,559
Basha!

549
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:51,011
Basha! Wait.

550
00:30:51,091 --> 00:30:53,668
I want to speak to Basha.
Sir, Sunday special.

551
00:30:53,748 --> 00:30:57,478
I have prepared chicken, mutton etc..

552
00:30:57,558 --> 00:31:03,881
Pivot Krishna did not eat
for three days. I fed him mutton.

553
00:31:04,364 --> 00:31:08,009
Sir, give me my payment.
- Ram! Ram, he is drunk.

554
00:31:09,229 --> 00:31:10,338
Great.

555
00:31:10,418 --> 00:31:12,361
Sir, you are great. Great.

556
00:31:13,155 --> 00:31:15,720
Actually,
Krishna is the name of our dog.

557
00:31:16,126 --> 00:31:18,439
I got it while rescuing Bharat.

558
00:31:18,858 --> 00:31:22,942
So, we have given it a pet name.
Pivot Krishna.

559
00:31:23,343 --> 00:31:25,741
It cannot eat without liquor smell.

560
00:31:25,821 --> 00:31:27,785
He is dedicated to them.

561
00:31:27,865 --> 00:31:31,395
So, he drinks in the
morning and feeds them.

562
00:31:32,672 --> 00:31:34,700
Meet our cook, Cocko.

563
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:36,351
Hi!
- Khushi...

564
00:31:36,662 --> 00:31:38,419
Pay him more and send him away.

565
00:31:39,067 --> 00:31:42,510
Come on, take him away...
- Sir...

566
00:31:42,590 --> 00:31:44,681
Shall we see the ashram?
- Yes.

567
00:31:44,761 --> 00:31:45,611
Please come.

568
00:31:47,373 --> 00:31:50,029
I have seen humans meditating.

569
00:31:50,109 --> 00:31:52,487
I am seeing dog meditation
for the first time.

570
00:31:52,567 --> 00:31:55,513
I am doing this for my Kariya.

571
00:31:59,159 --> 00:32:02,609
Idiot! He is using
us for flirting with her.

572
00:32:02,689 --> 00:32:06,625
Hey, we can do
anything for her sake.

573
00:32:06,705 --> 00:32:09,133
Where is she?
- No. Look down.

574
00:32:09,213 --> 00:32:10,309
You are right.

575
00:32:10,389 --> 00:32:13,036
She is beautiful.
- Look at her lips!

576
00:32:13,116 --> 00:32:14,990
She is fabulous.

577
00:32:15,070 --> 00:32:17,031
She is looking so beautiful!

578
00:32:17,111 --> 00:32:18,895
She is looking very beautiful.

579
00:32:18,975 --> 00:32:20,640
She is mine.

580
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,622
No. She is mine.

581
00:32:22,702 --> 00:32:23,517
She is mine.

582
00:32:23,597 --> 00:32:25,795
Can I allow Chintu to mix with them?

583
00:32:25,875 --> 00:32:27,977
She is going to come near us.

584
00:32:28,057 --> 00:32:30,270
Allow. They are very friendly.
- Okay.

585
00:32:30,350 --> 00:32:31,770
Please don't keep me down.
- Chintu...

586
00:32:31,850 --> 00:32:35,387
Run...
- Come on, she is going. Follow her.

587
00:32:35,467 --> 00:32:37,577
Ram! My Chintu!

588
00:32:47,604 --> 00:32:49,428
Oh, baby!

589
00:32:50,282 --> 00:32:51,947
What happened, baby?

590
00:32:52,350 --> 00:32:54,825
Shameless dogs! Keep quiet.

591
00:32:54,905 --> 00:32:55,762
What is this, sir?

592
00:32:55,842 --> 00:32:59,031
I set up an ashram of
dogs for the sake of your love...

593
00:32:59,111 --> 00:33:00,656
But the dogs have
shown their true nature.

594
00:33:00,736 --> 00:33:03,411
Ram, is this a set up?

595
00:33:03,491 --> 00:33:06,510
Set up...
- Shut up.

596
00:33:11,681 --> 00:33:13,863
What happened?
- Rape.

597
00:33:14,210 --> 00:33:17,416
Damn it!

598
00:33:18,474 --> 00:33:21,736
I will find each and
every person who raped you.

599
00:33:21,816 --> 00:33:27,584
I will shoot each one
of them on their back.

600
00:33:27,664 --> 00:33:30,145
Sir, not me.

601
00:33:30,397 --> 00:33:31,704
Then, who?

602
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:34,570
Chintu, my dog.

603
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:36,487
How dare they...

604
00:33:38,126 --> 00:33:40,185
Have they not spared even the dogs?

605
00:33:40,265 --> 00:33:41,802
I will kill those persons,

606
00:33:41,882 --> 00:33:47,735
whoever they may be
without bothering about court cases.

607
00:33:48,654 --> 00:33:50,239
Take the gun and start the jeep.

608
00:33:50,319 --> 00:33:51,183
Sir...
- Give me the gun.

609
00:33:51,263 --> 00:33:53,823
Sir, dogs raped my dog.

610
00:33:55,527 --> 00:33:58,249
It is natural for
two dogs to have sex.

611
00:33:58,329 --> 00:33:59,758
You must have told me before.

612
00:33:59,838 --> 00:34:03,376
I became emotional,
broke the glass, and I am bleeding.

613
00:34:03,719 --> 00:34:05,040
Call the doctor.
- Call the nurse.

614
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:05,961
Okay, sir.

615
00:34:06,041 --> 00:34:07,619
She will give good treatment.
That is why.

616
00:34:07,699 --> 00:34:09,380
Sir, do not talk nonsense.

617
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:14,031
They lied about the
ashram and tied street dogs there.

618
00:34:14,797 --> 00:34:18,414
Chintu became their
target and was gang-raped.

619
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:22,775
As per IPC 228/A,

620
00:34:22,855 --> 00:34:26,882
you have to immediately arrest those
dogs who raped Chintu.

621
00:34:27,410 --> 00:34:29,876
Otherwise, you will be...
- I understood.

622
00:34:33,443 --> 00:34:34,570
You are under arrest.

623
00:34:35,126 --> 00:34:36,764
Let's go.
- Why hasn't anyone called me?

624
00:34:36,844 --> 00:34:38,075
Call me. Hello...
- Peter...

625
00:34:40,019 --> 00:34:40,874
Let us go.

626
00:34:42,774 --> 00:34:44,196
Chintu, my poor dog.

627
00:34:44,276 --> 00:34:45,284
Sir!

628
00:34:46,892 --> 00:34:49,797
I have not worn this
uniform for pleasure.

629
00:34:49,992 --> 00:34:53,003
I have worn this
to do my duty sincerely.

630
00:34:53,083 --> 00:34:55,139
I have many characters.

631
00:34:56,165 --> 00:34:58,850
Each character is a chapter.

632
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:03,594
Rogues, I will thrash you
for doing this. Will punch you.

633
00:35:04,173 --> 00:35:05,303
Sudip, sir!

634
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,201
He is Kicha Sudip. Isn't it?

635
00:35:08,516 --> 00:35:10,744
He is Kicha Sudip. Right?
- Yes.

636
00:35:10,824 --> 00:35:11,690
Really?
- My, God!

637
00:35:11,770 --> 00:35:13,692
Do I look like Sudip, sir?

638
00:35:13,772 --> 00:35:14,977
Are you not Sudip, sir?

639
00:35:15,057 --> 00:35:16,446
No. I am Krantikumar.

640
00:35:17,415 --> 00:35:19,859
I got confused. I thought
you were Sudip, sir. - Thank you.

641
00:35:21,056 --> 00:35:22,735
Sorry, sir.
- I broke the glass out of excitement.

642
00:35:22,965 --> 00:35:25,730
Okay. Sir, will you repeat it.

643
00:35:25,810 --> 00:35:28,373
Especially the last punch.

644
00:35:29,723 --> 00:35:31,361
They are my fans.

645
00:35:31,441 --> 00:35:33,111
Look, he will do as he does.

646
00:35:33,345 --> 00:35:34,877
I will punch you.

647
00:35:35,674 --> 00:35:37,724
Thank God! Super, sir.
- Super, sir. Super.

648
00:35:37,804 --> 00:35:38,663
Super, sir.
- Super.

649
00:35:38,743 --> 00:35:40,240
Exactly like Sudip, sir.

650
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:42,701
We are your followers.
- Do not lie.

651
00:35:42,781 --> 00:35:44,306
I will kick you with my boots.
- No, sir.

652
00:35:44,386 --> 00:35:46,552
We are the first persons
to like your videos. - Is it?

653
00:35:46,632 --> 00:35:48,580
We are members of your
fan association club.

654
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:49,855
Is it?
- Yes, sir.

655
00:35:49,935 --> 00:35:50,804
Are these the four people?

656
00:35:50,884 --> 00:35:52,460
You uploaded a video
like Darshan, sir.

657
00:35:52,865 --> 00:35:54,959
Is it?
- What an act it was!

658
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:57,355
You are of a different level.
- Super, sir.

659
00:35:57,435 --> 00:35:59,803
Please do it again. Please, sir...
- I will do. I will do that.

660
00:36:00,174 --> 00:36:01,464
I will do.
- He will show us.

661
00:36:01,544 --> 00:36:02,849
He will show us.
- 340...

662
00:36:02,929 --> 00:36:05,108
Take out the mobiles.
- Give him.

663
00:36:06,916 --> 00:36:08,829
These are the moustaches
of each character.

664
00:36:09,056 --> 00:36:10,485
This is of Rajkumar,
this one is of Ambarish,

665
00:36:10,565 --> 00:36:11,388
this one of Shankar...

666
00:36:11,795 --> 00:36:14,474
Look at this. This is of challenging
star Darshan. - Super, sir.

667
00:36:21,312 --> 00:36:23,686
Do I look like Darshan, sir?
- Exactly, sir.

668
00:36:23,766 --> 00:36:25,230
Thank you.
- Okay...

669
00:36:25,310 --> 00:36:26,979
Take pictures from different angles.
- Yes...

670
00:36:27,059 --> 00:36:27,900
Why?

671
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:29,203
Ready, sir! Action.

672
00:36:30,005 --> 00:36:31,606
Cadburys!

673
00:36:32,981 --> 00:36:34,829
I am on the way. Tie it.

674
00:36:35,095 --> 00:36:38,671
We protect
the lives of women.

675
00:36:38,751 --> 00:36:42,857
We have not spared anyone
who tried to kill their husbands.

676
00:36:42,937 --> 00:36:47,586
Do you think we will spare
them if they touch the women?

677
00:36:48,021 --> 00:36:49,216
Hail!

678
00:36:49,296 --> 00:36:53,225
Very good. Please wait.
- There is still some more.

679
00:36:53,305 --> 00:36:55,766
I will deliver the full dialogue.
Thank, God!

680
00:36:55,959 --> 00:36:57,294
Sir, please keep your
hand on the moustache.

681
00:36:58,441 --> 00:37:01,123
Why are you being cheap and
getting involved in this dog case?

682
00:37:01,203 --> 00:37:04,709
You are at a higher level.

683
00:37:04,789 --> 00:37:06,927
You have to handle the case
of an elephant, lion or a tiger.

684
00:37:07,007 --> 00:37:08,752
Even I like it that way.

685
00:37:09,177 --> 00:37:10,439
This girl is a law student.

686
00:37:10,983 --> 00:37:12,212
She threatened me.

687
00:37:13,136 --> 00:37:14,383
What shall I do?

688
00:37:14,463 --> 00:37:17,132
Sir! Sir, arrest us. Arrest us, sir.

689
00:37:17,212 --> 00:37:18,721
It is our good fortune
that you will arrest us.

690
00:37:18,801 --> 00:37:20,069
Arrest us, sir. Arrest us.
- Oh no.

691
00:37:20,149 --> 00:37:22,233
I mustn't not arrest my fans.
Then I will not get 'likes'.

692
00:37:22,313 --> 00:37:23,586
What shall I do then?
- Chintu!

693
00:37:23,666 --> 00:37:24,705
Boys!

694
00:37:25,145 --> 00:37:26,842
Why are you surrounding me?
- Nothing...

695
00:37:26,922 --> 00:37:29,049
Your moustache...

696
00:37:30,182 --> 00:37:32,102
Please sit here.

697
00:37:34,891 --> 00:37:37,927
Dear, you look angry.

698
00:37:38,007 --> 00:37:43,588
If your dog can show
us the dog that raped her,

699
00:37:43,668 --> 00:37:45,705
we are ready to get
her married to our dog.

700
00:37:45,785 --> 00:37:47,048
Ask, sir, if he is ready?

701
00:37:47,128 --> 00:37:48,430
Sir, do you agree to this?
- Yes.

702
00:37:48,510 --> 00:37:50,632
Madam, are you ready?
- What? No way.

703
00:37:51,142 --> 00:37:52,569
One second.

704
00:37:52,649 --> 00:37:54,776
How will a dog tie nuptial
thread to another dog?

705
00:37:55,178 --> 00:37:57,367
You are right sir, absolutely right.
- Thank you.

706
00:37:58,274 --> 00:38:01,252
I am ready to tie the nuptial
thread for the sake of my dog.

707
00:38:01,831 --> 00:38:05,076
Ask her if she is ready to
marry me for the sake of her dog?

708
00:38:05,241 --> 00:38:07,069
Naughty boy!
- Are you ready, madam?

709
00:38:08,075 --> 00:38:08,877
Shit!

710
00:38:08,957 --> 00:38:11,759
Hey, wait.
- For the sake of your dog...

711
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:16,344
Leave me.

712
00:38:20,483 --> 00:38:22,723
You still have no children.

713
00:38:22,803 --> 00:38:24,830
You do business for
a living.

714
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:27,778
Such a lovely wife!

715
00:38:29,465 --> 00:38:31,800
You lead a good life.

716
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:34,789
Why are you obsessed with
your house and refuse to sell it?

717
00:38:34,869 --> 00:38:37,542
My buildings are coming
up around your lands.

718
00:38:37,856 --> 00:38:41,194
My brother wants to
build a swimming pool here.

719
00:38:41,619 --> 00:38:43,036
Feel it, son. Feel it.

720
00:38:43,116 --> 00:38:48,756
It will be lovely to swim
and look at the buildings.

721
00:38:48,836 --> 00:38:50,167
Sign.

722
00:38:50,247 --> 00:38:53,242
I will not give this land
to you even if I have to die.

723
00:38:53,322 --> 00:38:54,551
We would not have
entered this house,

724
00:38:54,631 --> 00:38:56,549
if we wanted to grab this
house without killing someone.

725
00:38:57,147 --> 00:38:59,630
Your hands are so beautiful.

726
00:39:00,424 --> 00:39:06,472
How beautiful will your body be!

727
00:39:07,340 --> 00:39:08,704
Let me go.

728
00:39:17,334 --> 00:39:19,711
Boss, they are very good people.

729
00:39:20,554 --> 00:39:24,179
They signed without creating a fuss.

730
00:39:26,744 --> 00:39:31,681
Good people like us find good persons,
like the people in the slum.

731
00:39:31,761 --> 00:39:35,348
I feel that will not come
to us unless you come here.

732
00:39:35,843 --> 00:39:38,411
I am coming to India
in another ten days.

733
00:39:38,582 --> 00:39:40,519
Wait until then.

734
00:39:42,236 --> 00:39:46,875
I understood.
We have to act silently.

735
00:39:47,346 --> 00:39:48,794
Greetings, sir.
- Greetings.

736
00:39:48,874 --> 00:39:49,931
This viral fever,

737
00:39:50,011 --> 00:39:51,521
is due to the weather change.
- Greetings, doctor.

738
00:39:51,601 --> 00:39:52,996
It is more nowadays.
- Okay.

739
00:39:53,396 --> 00:39:54,767
Is your daughter fine?
- Yes, doctor.

740
00:40:08,544 --> 00:40:09,784
Take the tablet twice
a day for a week.

741
00:40:09,864 --> 00:40:11,240
You will be fine.
- Okay, doctor.

742
00:40:11,956 --> 00:40:13,991
Give the tablets that
I have brought. - Okay.

743
00:40:14,071 --> 00:40:16,707
Also, take their blood samples
and come to the hospital. - Okay.

744
00:40:16,787 --> 00:40:17,965
Do not forget.
- Sure, sir.

745
00:40:18,045 --> 00:40:19,517
Ram, I will go now.

746
00:40:19,597 --> 00:40:20,862
Hope all are fine?

747
00:40:20,942 --> 00:40:22,814
This area is not so clean.
So, it is shared.

748
00:40:22,894 --> 00:40:24,509
Nothing to worry.
- Please come, doctor.

749
00:40:24,589 --> 00:40:26,740
You stay here and take care.
I will go.

750
00:40:28,624 --> 00:40:30,173
Where is Peter?

751
00:40:30,253 --> 00:40:33,179
Has he gone to Bharti Bhavan
early in the morning?

752
00:40:33,259 --> 00:40:34,760
We could have checked
him also if he was here.

753
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:36,365
May be, he was not well.

754
00:40:43,657 --> 00:40:44,816
Janaki!

755
00:40:46,427 --> 00:40:52,553
Look, I would not have left
you if we were to be together.

756
00:40:52,988 --> 00:40:55,385
Do not come and trouble me.

757
00:40:55,465 --> 00:40:58,593
Trouble? Please do not say that.

758
00:40:59,164 --> 00:41:02,465
We united on this day and
we got separated on the same day.

759
00:41:02,902 --> 00:41:05,198
This is the only special
day for me in a year.

760
00:41:05,646 --> 00:41:08,760
I know your heart will
not melt despite my efforts.

761
00:41:09,423 --> 00:41:11,169
But I will not stop my efforts.

762
00:41:11,988 --> 00:41:16,328
I am living only in the hope
that I will see my daughter once.

763
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:22,074
Janaki, please let me
see my daughter, just once.

764
00:41:22,386 --> 00:41:24,447
It is impossible.

765
00:41:25,294 --> 00:41:29,279
I will not pardon you for
your mistakes and your words to me.

766
00:41:29,359 --> 00:41:31,081
Do not come to see us ever.

767
00:41:31,914 --> 00:41:33,589
I have brought
our daughter up in a way,

768
00:41:33,669 --> 00:41:34,840
that she does not need a father.

769
00:41:35,485 --> 00:41:38,514
Please go away from here.

770
00:41:38,594 --> 00:41:40,099
Janaki, please...

771
00:42:08,579 --> 00:42:09,382
It is my mother.

772
00:42:12,132 --> 00:42:14,078
Hello!
- What are you doing, Khushi?

773
00:42:15,145 --> 00:42:16,486
Studying for the exams.

774
00:42:17,068 --> 00:42:20,432
Stop your tantrums.
Study well and try to pass the exam.

775
00:42:20,861 --> 00:42:23,140
Do not worry.

776
00:42:23,220 --> 00:42:27,613
I will definitely pass
this time and become a lawyer.

777
00:42:27,693 --> 00:42:28,691
Okay?

778
00:42:29,778 --> 00:42:30,998
Alright.
- Bye.

779
00:42:37,847 --> 00:42:38,666
Peter...

780
00:42:38,746 --> 00:42:42,038
You will pay for the drinks
this time and I will pay for food.

781
00:42:43,859 --> 00:42:46,017
Peter likes pickles. Give him.
- Yes...

782
00:42:46,097 --> 00:42:47,811
Give me pickles.

783
00:42:47,891 --> 00:42:49,651
Is everything ready? Start.

784
00:42:50,196 --> 00:42:51,433
Peter!

785
00:42:51,814 --> 00:42:53,243
Leave it.
- Peter!

786
00:42:53,323 --> 00:42:54,133
Leave.

787
00:42:54,213 --> 00:42:55,476
I will not give drinks to you today.

788
00:42:55,556 --> 00:42:58,741
I have been trying to tell
you my story since you were a child.

789
00:42:58,821 --> 00:43:01,360
But you drank cool
drinks and ran away.

790
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:02,796
Now you are grown up
and are drinking liquor.

791
00:43:02,876 --> 00:43:05,813
You will drink this and leave me.
To whom shall I tell my story?

792
00:43:06,310 --> 00:43:07,128
To whom shall I tell my story?

793
00:43:07,208 --> 00:43:08,726
Peter! Please do not joke, Peter.

794
00:43:08,806 --> 00:43:10,922
We never refused to hear your story.
- Yes.

795
00:43:11,002 --> 00:43:14,105
Once you open the bottle,
we can concentrate well.

796
00:43:14,185 --> 00:43:15,959
Then see our emotion.

797
00:43:16,039 --> 00:43:17,858
We will hear your story.
- No...

798
00:43:17,938 --> 00:43:19,237
What did you do last time?

799
00:43:19,627 --> 00:43:22,926
You drank and then slept.

800
00:43:23,006 --> 00:43:29,918
I was telling my story
to every nut and bolt here.

801
00:43:29,998 --> 00:43:32,938
Don't you ever feel
like listening to my story?

802
00:43:33,420 --> 00:43:35,025
Today I will not give you drinks.

803
00:43:35,105 --> 00:43:36,995
You have to listen to my story.
Be silent.

804
00:43:37,498 --> 00:43:39,479
Is it a joke for you?
- Give some.

805
00:43:39,559 --> 00:43:40,969
Is it a joke?

806
00:43:41,885 --> 00:43:43,163
Please. Little...
- No!

807
00:43:43,497 --> 00:43:44,843
I will hold it carefully.
- No need.

808
00:43:53,530 --> 00:43:54,879
He is drinking without giving to us.

809
00:43:54,959 --> 00:43:56,388
Ram!
- Yes?

810
00:43:56,468 --> 00:43:57,444
Who am I?

811
00:43:57,524 --> 00:43:58,776
Peter.
- No.

812
00:43:59,467 --> 00:44:01,776
Who am I?

813
00:44:01,922 --> 00:44:02,889
An artist.

814
00:44:02,969 --> 00:44:07,596
Yes. An artist has a heart. Right?

815
00:44:08,561 --> 00:44:10,530
the heart has feelings.

816
00:44:11,481 --> 00:44:14,546
And feelings have love.

817
00:44:15,845 --> 00:44:19,129
The name of that love is Janaki.

818
00:44:20,669 --> 00:44:22,418
As soon as I uttered
Janaki's name...

819
00:44:24,337 --> 00:44:25,860
Can you hear it?

820
00:44:26,665 --> 00:44:30,127
My heart beat increased.

821
00:44:36,937 --> 00:44:41,652
'One day I was collecting money by
painting to help school children.'

822
00:44:41,732 --> 00:44:44,213
'Janaki also contributed
to help the children.'

823
00:44:44,446 --> 00:44:49,986
'I drew her picture.
She drew my picture in her heart.'

824
00:44:50,066 --> 00:44:53,375
'Our friendship began,'

825
00:44:53,455 --> 00:44:57,099
'with a cup of coffee
and turned into love,'

826
00:44:57,179 --> 00:44:58,441
'before we finished it.'

827
00:44:58,855 --> 00:45:00,445
'Janaki weds Peter.'

828
00:45:00,686 --> 00:45:02,574
'Sounds great. Right?'

829
00:45:03,066 --> 00:45:04,054
'But what to do?'

830
00:45:04,134 --> 00:45:06,523
'Janaki's family and our
society did not accept it.'

831
00:45:06,934 --> 00:45:10,701
'Janaki's brother brought goons and
attacked me on the marriage day.'

832
00:45:10,988 --> 00:45:14,250
'I wanted to be with Janaki.
So, I hit her brother.'

833
00:45:14,330 --> 00:45:15,370
'I should not have done it.'

834
00:45:15,450 --> 00:45:19,200
'After that Janaki became pregnant.'

835
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:20,653
'Everything was going on well.'

836
00:45:20,819 --> 00:45:22,208
'But it was my bad luck.'

837
00:45:22,288 --> 00:45:24,674
'I could not earn during
the Dasara exhibition.'

838
00:45:24,754 --> 00:45:28,041
'I took a lot of loans
and was struggling.'

839
00:45:28,121 --> 00:45:32,768
'Janaki could not bear to see it.
She sought her brother's help.'

840
00:45:33,149 --> 00:45:35,918
'She said that we had to do
it for the sake of our child.'

841
00:45:35,998 --> 00:45:37,985
'She told me to
work for her brother.'

842
00:45:38,300 --> 00:45:40,075
'We started fighting.'

843
00:45:40,155 --> 00:45:44,926
'Our temper rose, and I screamed, 'do
we need this wretched child now?'

844
00:45:45,006 --> 00:45:49,259
'Janaki left me before dawn
for having spoken like that.'

845
00:45:49,634 --> 00:45:51,012
'I searched the entire
Mysore for her.'

846
00:45:51,544 --> 00:45:52,571
'I could not find her.'

847
00:45:53,433 --> 00:45:55,438
'After four years,
I came to know that she was,'

848
00:45:55,518 --> 00:45:57,277
'working as a school
teacher in Bangalore.'

849
00:45:58,372 --> 00:45:59,955
'I went and met her there.'

850
00:46:00,035 --> 00:46:02,716
'Janaki rejected me outright.'

851
00:46:03,215 --> 00:46:05,479
'I requested her to show
me the child at least once.'

852
00:46:05,801 --> 00:46:09,648
'She pointed to a group of children
and told me to find my child.'

853
00:46:09,728 --> 00:46:11,922
'I did not know whether
it was a male or female child.'

854
00:46:12,002 --> 00:46:15,316
'I searched for my child
among all the children.'

855
00:46:15,797 --> 00:46:16,968
'Then she said that
it is a female child.'

856
00:46:17,048 --> 00:46:20,341
'But it is her child.'

857
00:46:20,821 --> 00:46:26,417
'She said that she would
die if I try to see the child.'

858
00:46:27,761 --> 00:46:29,678
'She is a self-respecting lady.'

859
00:46:31,544 --> 00:46:32,817
'She will do as she says.'

860
00:46:33,618 --> 00:46:37,707
Yes. Out of fear,
I did not try to see my daughter.

861
00:46:41,560 --> 00:46:43,561
Every year,
on our wedding anniversary,

862
00:46:44,242 --> 00:46:45,942
I go and meet her, wherever I am.

863
00:46:47,245 --> 00:46:50,195
But she is hard hearted.
I have not seen my daughter.

864
00:46:50,275 --> 00:46:52,016
She still has the same mentality.

865
00:46:53,405 --> 00:46:59,172
I am happy today because of you.

866
00:47:01,555 --> 00:47:04,328
I am fortunate to have got you.

867
00:47:12,768 --> 00:47:14,341
Take. Start.

868
00:47:15,677 --> 00:47:16,644
Start.

869
00:47:21,233 --> 00:47:22,106
Peter!

870
00:47:23,875 --> 00:47:31,335
We will bring
your daughter to you one day.

871
00:47:38,261 --> 00:47:39,963
Distinguishing the features,

872
00:47:40,043 --> 00:47:43,039
of which jurisdiction of
Supreme court and high court and...

873
00:47:45,461 --> 00:47:46,276
Okay. Okay. Next question.

874
00:47:46,356 --> 00:47:47,648
What are the types of bailments?

875
00:47:49,841 --> 00:47:52,702
One. For the benefit
of the bailor and bailee.

876
00:47:52,782 --> 00:47:55,070
Two. For the sole benefit of...

877
00:47:56,165 --> 00:47:57,767
For the sole benefit of...

878
00:48:01,309 --> 00:48:02,632
Who is that?

879
00:48:06,471 --> 00:48:07,776
Is the camera on?
- Yes, boss.

880
00:48:07,856 --> 00:48:09,304
Zoom in.
- Zoom in, boss.

881
00:48:09,384 --> 00:48:11,140
Yes. Give me the microphone.

882
00:48:12,209 --> 00:48:15,302
Final year law students,

883
00:48:15,382 --> 00:48:19,446
taking exams with
the help of blue tooth.

884
00:48:19,526 --> 00:48:24,976
Let us talk about this
exclusive program. Welcome.

885
00:48:25,056 --> 00:48:25,933
Tell us, madam.

886
00:48:26,013 --> 00:48:29,779
You are helping your
friend to pass the exam.

887
00:48:29,859 --> 00:48:33,032
Our channel appreciates
your bravery. Now you talk.

888
00:48:33,112 --> 00:48:35,917
Here.
- Hello, you are talking nonsense.

889
00:48:35,997 --> 00:48:38,041
We are doing group study.

890
00:48:38,121 --> 00:48:39,572
Isn't it?
- Yes.

891
00:48:39,652 --> 00:48:43,803
They are lying though we have proof.

892
00:48:43,883 --> 00:48:45,958
Hello, what proof do you have?

893
00:48:46,038 --> 00:48:48,360
Hello sting reporter, Mr Satish.

894
00:48:49,295 --> 00:48:50,642
Sir, take.

895
00:48:53,473 --> 00:48:56,956
'You read the questions
from here one by one.' - Oh, no.

896
00:48:57,036 --> 00:49:00,373
'If a question is there,
I will cough once.'

897
00:49:01,623 --> 00:49:03,998
'Otherwise, I will cough twice.'

898
00:49:05,226 --> 00:49:07,721
Is this proof enough
or do you want more?

899
00:49:07,801 --> 00:49:09,228
Only one more question is left.

900
00:49:09,308 --> 00:49:10,803
Please help us, sir.

901
00:49:11,167 --> 00:49:13,997
She is my lover.
I will surely help her.

902
00:49:14,675 --> 00:49:15,717
Thank you, sir.
- Thank you, sir.

903
00:49:15,797 --> 00:49:17,383
Now give me the phone.
- Sir, phone...

904
00:49:19,090 --> 00:49:20,165
Dear!

905
00:49:22,298 --> 00:49:23,575
You?

906
00:49:24,748 --> 00:49:27,591
Dear, even I want
an answer to a question.

907
00:49:27,671 --> 00:49:30,081
You also want an
answer to a question.

908
00:49:30,161 --> 00:49:32,499
Answer my question first.

909
00:49:32,579 --> 00:49:35,477
Then we will answer your question.

910
00:49:35,803 --> 00:49:37,531
My question is...

911
00:49:37,611 --> 00:49:40,600
Dear, I love you.

912
00:49:41,004 --> 00:49:43,245
If you agree, cough once.

913
00:49:44,766 --> 00:49:47,101
Otherwise, cough twice.

914
00:49:47,307 --> 00:49:50,671
If you cough twice,

915
00:49:50,751 --> 00:49:53,223
I will come there
and trap you with proof.

916
00:49:53,396 --> 00:49:54,707
Now say.

917
00:49:54,787 --> 00:49:57,004
Is it a yes or a no?

918
00:54:28,755 --> 00:54:31,389
Calm down.
We will get it. You will be fine.

919
00:54:31,652 --> 00:54:33,788
Did you get the blood?
- Yes, got it. I am on my way.

920
00:54:33,868 --> 00:54:34,950
Okay. Okay.

921
00:54:35,736 --> 00:54:37,630
Boss, the tire is punctured.

922
00:54:46,723 --> 00:54:51,257
Brother! Ten fighters are waiting
in the nearby garage. Come soon.

923
00:55:53,180 --> 00:55:54,025
Hit him.

924
00:56:59,150 --> 00:57:00,576
I made a mistake. Please take.

925
00:57:04,950 --> 00:57:05,945
It is my boss.

926
00:57:07,239 --> 00:57:08,570
Is the work over?

927
00:57:09,616 --> 00:57:12,454
Badri, not only your boys,

928
00:57:12,937 --> 00:57:16,467
even you cannot snatch
my area from me.

929
00:57:16,547 --> 00:57:18,266
I will come. I will come,

930
00:57:18,346 --> 00:57:20,827
and show you the effect
of my presence there.

931
00:57:20,907 --> 00:57:22,373
Come...

932
00:57:22,958 --> 00:57:26,636
But bring a good batch
of goons with you this time.

933
00:57:30,414 --> 00:57:34,139
Ram, I said I would donate my blood.

934
00:57:34,219 --> 00:57:37,148
But they wanted A- blood.

935
00:57:37,743 --> 00:57:41,725
You appeared like God and
saved my daughter and the child.

936
00:57:45,666 --> 00:57:47,985
Please do not be emotional.

937
00:57:49,583 --> 00:57:50,695
Brother, enough of your acting.

938
00:57:50,775 --> 00:57:52,080
Is it enough?
- Yes.

939
00:57:52,396 --> 00:57:55,289
We will be happy if you
give tea without asking for money.

940
00:57:55,838 --> 00:57:56,693
Okay?

941
00:57:56,773 --> 00:57:58,247
Look at the child and be happy.

942
00:58:19,143 --> 00:58:21,411
Wow!
- Very beautiful. Isn't it?

943
00:58:21,491 --> 00:58:22,687
Thank you.

944
00:58:26,276 --> 00:58:27,305
Uncle!

945
00:58:29,284 --> 00:58:31,108
You have painted very well.

946
00:58:31,188 --> 00:58:32,658
Thank you.
- I am Khushi.

947
00:58:33,715 --> 00:58:34,680
Peter.

948
00:58:34,980 --> 00:58:39,511
I felt the emotion which
I lost in my life in your painting.

949
00:58:39,789 --> 00:58:41,687
So, I felt sad.

950
00:58:42,529 --> 00:58:43,553
I am sorry.

951
00:58:44,149 --> 00:58:45,016
It is okay.

952
00:58:45,330 --> 00:58:46,838
I felt very happy,

953
00:58:46,918 --> 00:58:49,741
on seeing you helping the poor
kids with your art.

954
00:58:49,821 --> 00:58:53,027
Yes, dear. There are
studious children in our area.

955
00:58:53,339 --> 00:58:58,190
I help them by giving
books and bags.

956
00:58:58,270 --> 00:59:00,604
I will also contribute
to your cause.

957
00:59:01,147 --> 00:59:02,474
Will make my painting?

958
00:59:02,554 --> 00:59:05,426
Thank you. Please come...
- Thank you.

959
00:59:06,212 --> 00:59:07,335
Come.
- Hold this.

960
00:59:09,453 --> 00:59:10,820
Sit there. Come on.
- Yes.

961
00:59:39,757 --> 00:59:41,202
Wow!

962
00:59:44,099 --> 00:59:45,383
Wow!

963
00:59:46,085 --> 00:59:47,504
It is beautiful, uncle.

964
00:59:48,119 --> 00:59:49,798
Do you paint here every day?

965
00:59:49,878 --> 00:59:52,639
Today I am here.
Tomorrow, I'll be somewhere else.

966
00:59:52,719 --> 00:59:55,276
Uncle, I feel like
seeing all your paintings.

967
00:59:55,356 --> 00:59:56,841
You are free to come to my house.

968
00:59:56,921 --> 00:59:59,043
If you have no other work,
come tomorrow.

969
00:59:59,764 --> 01:00:02,229
This looks like some painting.
Isn't it?

970
01:00:03,242 --> 01:00:04,895
Please come. Yes.

971
01:00:06,127 --> 01:00:08,051
Where will you sit?

972
01:00:13,302 --> 01:00:14,297
Wow!

973
01:00:15,034 --> 01:00:18,340
Uncle, is this a
house or an exhibition?

974
01:00:19,085 --> 01:00:20,936
It is so beautiful.

975
01:00:21,580 --> 01:00:23,504
What inspires you to paint so well?

976
01:00:23,584 --> 01:00:27,923
I feel happy and
sad when I see these paintings.

977
01:00:28,003 --> 01:00:32,010
Because I cannot become
young to play like children.

978
01:00:32,090 --> 01:00:36,724
And I definitely do not have
a child's heart now. - So true.

979
01:00:44,651 --> 01:00:46,122
Excuse me...

980
01:00:51,655 --> 01:00:52,565
It is okay.

981
01:00:53,631 --> 01:00:54,668
Okay...

982
01:00:55,591 --> 01:00:56,972
Is it neat and clean now?

983
01:00:57,335 --> 01:00:58,982
It is an artist's place.
You should not look at the floor.

984
01:00:59,062 --> 01:01:00,439
Look at the walls.

985
01:01:01,317 --> 01:01:02,658
What will you have? Coffee or tea?

986
01:01:02,738 --> 01:01:04,965
Uncle, is aunt not there?

987
01:01:05,427 --> 01:01:06,612
Aunt...

988
01:01:07,599 --> 01:01:08,472
She is in Dubai.

989
01:01:08,696 --> 01:01:10,157
She comes once a year.

990
01:01:10,237 --> 01:01:11,329
Only once?
- Yes.

991
01:01:11,409 --> 01:01:12,668
That is why I could paint so much.

992
01:01:14,297 --> 01:01:16,892
Forget about her.
Do you want coffee or tea?

993
01:01:17,771 --> 01:01:19,461
You say. Is coffee okay?

994
01:01:19,822 --> 01:01:21,905
How can I say in my house...

995
01:01:21,985 --> 01:01:23,638
Uncle, you sit.
- It is dirty here.

996
01:01:23,718 --> 01:01:25,034
I will prepare coffee.

997
01:01:25,880 --> 01:01:28,434
Khushi filter coffee.
You must drink it.

998
01:01:30,453 --> 01:01:31,442
Uncle!
- Yes?

999
01:01:31,522 --> 01:01:34,089
Where is the milk?
- It is in a steel vessel.

1000
01:01:34,169 --> 01:01:35,831
Coffee?
- Brown box.

1001
01:01:35,911 --> 01:01:38,084
Sugar?
- Red box.

1002
01:01:44,187 --> 01:01:47,563
Even my wife used
to ask such questions,

1003
01:01:47,643 --> 01:01:50,502
when we were newly married.

1004
01:02:08,625 --> 01:02:11,016
Take this. It is hot.

1005
01:02:15,150 --> 01:02:16,914
Hello!
- Where are you, Khushi?

1006
01:02:17,678 --> 01:02:19,811
College over. I am on the way home.

1007
01:02:19,891 --> 01:02:21,819
Okay. Go home carefully.

1008
01:02:21,899 --> 01:02:22,814
Okay. Bye.

1009
01:02:23,243 --> 01:02:26,472
The coffee is very nice.
- Thank you.

1010
01:02:26,552 --> 01:02:28,399
Our area is very interesting.

1011
01:02:28,479 --> 01:02:29,576
Come. I will introduce
you to all of them.

1012
01:02:29,656 --> 01:02:31,239
Okay.
- Come.

1013
01:02:33,050 --> 01:02:35,738
Pramod, collect the
blood test reports fast.

1014
01:02:36,221 --> 01:02:38,552
We can give them insurance
cards if we get it soon.

1015
01:02:38,632 --> 01:02:40,162
Ram, do not worry.

1016
01:02:40,242 --> 01:02:41,902
I will collect all
their blood reports,

1017
01:02:41,982 --> 01:02:44,081
and issue them cards in three days.
It is my responsibility.

1018
01:02:44,161 --> 01:02:45,303
Okay? Over?

1019
01:02:45,887 --> 01:02:48,456
Abdullah. He presses clothes.

1020
01:02:48,536 --> 01:02:52,477
He is coughing Venkateswarlu.
Called as 'corona' Venkateshwar.

1021
01:02:52,557 --> 01:02:53,437
Ram!

1022
01:02:54,623 --> 01:02:55,598
Everything is okay.

1023
01:02:57,267 --> 01:02:59,140
My friend, Khushi.

1024
01:03:00,115 --> 01:03:01,033
Is it he?

1025
01:03:01,113 --> 01:03:05,953
Peter, don't you know
our level and area range?

1026
01:03:06,033 --> 01:03:06,835
Why? What happened?

1027
01:03:06,915 --> 01:03:09,588
Why have you brought
useless people here?

1028
01:03:09,668 --> 01:03:11,315
Hello, mind your tongue.

1029
01:03:11,395 --> 01:03:13,046
She is speaking in English!

1030
01:03:14,125 --> 01:03:17,371
Talk to the cable operator
or milkman like this. Not to me.

1031
01:03:17,685 --> 01:03:21,445
What are you doing?
- Give way. Why are you fighting?

1032
01:03:21,525 --> 01:03:22,471
Do you know her?

1033
01:03:22,551 --> 01:03:24,730
Yes. Hey, you say.

1034
01:03:24,991 --> 01:03:29,075
Listen, she is the girl he
was referring to in his love story.

1035
01:03:29,155 --> 01:03:30,634
I see.
- Super!

1036
01:03:30,714 --> 01:03:32,528
He made a mess of
the whole thing. Right? - Yes.

1037
01:03:32,608 --> 01:03:34,798
I knew this would not work out.
- Baby...

1038
01:03:34,878 --> 01:03:36,946
You were asking for a housemaid.

1039
01:03:37,205 --> 01:03:38,990
Is this modern girl right for you?

1040
01:03:39,070 --> 01:03:41,704
I like this modern girl.

1041
01:03:41,784 --> 01:03:43,382
Okay, right?
- Please come.

1042
01:03:43,462 --> 01:03:45,603
I am sorry.
- Peter, I am going home. Bye.

1043
01:03:45,683 --> 01:03:47,707
Come early in the
morning to wash vessels.

1044
01:03:47,787 --> 01:03:49,890
Such a beautiful
girl to wash vessels!

1045
01:03:50,808 --> 01:03:52,756
Hail our leader Gopalan!

1046
01:03:52,836 --> 01:03:54,690
Hail our leader Gopalan!

1047
01:03:54,770 --> 01:03:56,869
Hail our leader Gopalan!

1048
01:03:58,002 --> 01:03:59,546
Congratulations, Gopalan, sir.

1049
01:03:59,626 --> 01:04:01,341
Hello! Sir...

1050
01:04:01,855 --> 01:04:02,928
Bless you.

1051
01:04:03,008 --> 01:04:06,135
I won because of the
people's love for you.

1052
01:04:06,215 --> 01:04:11,661
I consider this as an
opportunity to serve the people,

1053
01:04:11,741 --> 01:04:13,883
and not as my power.

1054
01:04:13,963 --> 01:04:16,091
I wanted a good service
oriented person like you,

1055
01:04:16,171 --> 01:04:19,168
to become a good leader.

1056
01:04:19,555 --> 01:04:21,375
This is the victory of democracy.

1057
01:04:21,455 --> 01:04:23,210
Thank you. Thank you, Raja, sir.
Thank you.

1058
01:04:23,290 --> 01:04:24,902
Hail our leader Gopalan!

1059
01:04:24,982 --> 01:04:26,774
Hail our leader Gopalan!

1060
01:04:29,528 --> 01:04:30,430
Venkatesa!

1061
01:04:30,932 --> 01:04:33,094
Why didn't you consult the
doctor when he came here yesterday?

1062
01:04:33,174 --> 01:04:35,626
You are coughing so much
that I fear you are spreading,

1063
01:04:35,706 --> 01:04:37,107
TB instead of tea.

1064
01:04:37,187 --> 01:04:38,434
Tie a curtain here.

1065
01:04:38,644 --> 01:04:40,085
Look at him. He is too much.

1066
01:04:40,165 --> 01:04:43,923
It is not TB.
My heart is paining due to cough.

1067
01:04:44,352 --> 01:04:46,646
You started again... Why?

1068
01:04:46,726 --> 01:04:49,258
Hello, Bapanna died.
- Who?

1069
01:04:50,277 --> 01:04:52,677
Is Bapanna dead?
- Yes, buddy.

1070
01:04:52,757 --> 01:04:55,583
I will come with
my assistant this time.

1071
01:04:55,663 --> 01:04:57,403
Who is that assistant?

1072
01:04:57,483 --> 01:04:59,205
Your friend Khushi.

1073
01:04:59,285 --> 01:05:00,498
Poor girl.

1074
01:05:00,578 --> 01:05:02,247
Do not pity her.
- Yes.

1075
01:05:02,327 --> 01:05:04,815
I will send her such a message,

1076
01:05:04,895 --> 01:05:07,329
that she will come to me begging.

1077
01:05:07,409 --> 01:05:08,515
Will you see?

1078
01:05:13,260 --> 01:05:15,403
What is it?

1079
01:05:16,457 --> 01:05:17,697
Is it him?

1080
01:05:23,752 --> 01:05:24,808
Hello, dear.

1081
01:05:24,888 --> 01:05:25,990
I am in the class.

1082
01:05:26,070 --> 01:05:30,255
If you do not come to
the location and act your part,

1083
01:05:30,561 --> 01:05:33,147
I will share your video
with the entire college.

1084
01:05:33,227 --> 01:05:34,451
Bye, dear.

1085
01:05:34,531 --> 01:05:36,688
Hello! Hello!

1086
01:05:40,252 --> 01:05:42,829
Yellamma! Maramma! Alamelamma!

1087
01:05:42,909 --> 01:05:47,129
Patalamma! Your mother
is greater than all of them.

1088
01:05:47,209 --> 01:05:50,533
Hail Annamma!
- Hail!

1089
01:05:50,936 --> 01:05:52,297
What a performance?

1090
01:05:52,928 --> 01:05:57,087
Hey, Bapanna, why did you cheat me?

1091
01:05:57,167 --> 01:05:58,936
What did I tell you?

1092
01:05:59,793 --> 01:06:01,079
What did I say?

1093
01:06:01,159 --> 01:06:05,153
What did you say, and
what did he hear? Tell me.

1094
01:06:05,233 --> 01:06:08,302
I told you to take
an insurance policy.

1095
01:06:08,382 --> 01:06:12,967
I asked you how my
daughter will survive,

1096
01:06:13,047 --> 01:06:17,241
if you die due to heavy drinking.

1097
01:06:18,056 --> 01:06:19,668
There is still time.

1098
01:06:19,748 --> 01:06:22,390
Even I want to come
whenever you call me.

1099
01:06:22,470 --> 01:06:23,997
But what to do?

1100
01:06:24,077 --> 01:06:26,353
I have a busy schedule.
That is why I have appointed,

1101
01:06:26,433 --> 01:06:28,967
insurance agents in every area.

1102
01:06:29,707 --> 01:06:31,564
They are all my children.

1103
01:06:31,644 --> 01:06:33,297
Why don't you understand?

1104
01:06:33,377 --> 01:06:35,265
We understood.

1105
01:06:35,345 --> 01:06:38,039
What should we do? Say.

1106
01:06:39,714 --> 01:06:41,078
I will tell.

1107
01:06:41,566 --> 01:06:42,975
I will tell.

1108
01:06:43,055 --> 01:06:45,859
Hey, son! Come here.

1109
01:06:46,167 --> 01:06:47,641
Go.
- Coming...

1110
01:06:47,721 --> 01:06:50,637
Not you. That boy...
- You...

1111
01:06:50,717 --> 01:06:51,539
Boss!

1112
01:06:52,219 --> 01:06:54,070
People here believe that
God has possessed her.

1113
01:06:54,150 --> 01:06:56,161
Better go.
Otherwise, they will beat you.

1114
01:06:56,241 --> 01:06:58,400
Go.
- Sit.

1115
01:07:05,336 --> 01:07:08,733
He is my disciple.

1116
01:07:08,813 --> 01:07:11,386
I have sent him here to serve you.

1117
01:07:11,466 --> 01:07:14,031
Son, where is the paper?

1118
01:07:15,012 --> 01:07:17,357
What paper?
- Application...

1119
01:07:17,437 --> 01:07:18,542
I agree.

1120
01:07:18,854 --> 01:07:21,153
Listen, buddy!
- Yes, buddy.

1121
01:07:21,233 --> 01:07:22,780
Distribute insurance policy
applications to all of them,

1122
01:07:22,860 --> 01:07:26,030
and take their consent.
Do it for free for this lady.

1123
01:07:26,110 --> 01:07:27,974
Madam, God instructed me just now...

1124
01:07:29,349 --> 01:07:33,528
Goddess! Do you have any other wish?
- Take. Here you go.

1125
01:07:33,608 --> 01:07:35,926
Child, come and take my blessings.
- Here, take it.

1126
01:07:36,006 --> 01:07:37,711
You...
- Take.

1127
01:07:37,791 --> 01:07:39,270
Never mind. I have blessed you.

1128
01:07:39,350 --> 01:07:41,303
My work is over.

1129
01:07:41,383 --> 01:07:43,145
I am leaving now.
- Oh, Goddess Annamma!

1130
01:07:43,225 --> 01:07:45,506
I am leaving now.
- Oh, Goddess Annamma!

1131
01:07:47,135 --> 01:07:50,330
The Goddess has left.
You can start the rituals.

1132
01:07:50,410 --> 01:07:51,439
Okay. Thank you.

1133
01:07:52,816 --> 01:07:54,734
'He looks handsome.'

1134
01:07:55,066 --> 01:07:56,772
'But why am I behaving like this?'

1135
01:07:58,300 --> 01:07:59,914
My boss could get a hundred
applications if he went alone.

1136
01:08:00,324 --> 01:08:02,861
But with Madam we
got two hundred applications.

1137
01:08:03,220 --> 01:08:06,590
The collection is good.
We will get a lot of commission.

1138
01:08:06,670 --> 01:08:07,785
Commission?
- Yes.

1139
01:08:07,865 --> 01:08:09,906
How much will you get?
- Lots of it, madam.

1140
01:08:09,986 --> 01:08:11,667
Boss is extremely rich.

1141
01:08:11,876 --> 01:08:15,289
Actually, he stays in
a slum in fear of an IT raid.

1142
01:08:15,369 --> 01:08:16,334
Is it?
- Yes.

1143
01:08:17,158 --> 01:08:18,232
Ram, I love you.

1144
01:08:23,150 --> 01:08:27,535
Buddy, is she still
possessed by God?

1145
01:08:27,615 --> 01:08:30,148
Ram, I really love you.

1146
01:08:33,771 --> 01:08:36,066
I hope it is not a dream!
- Not at all.

1147
01:08:37,063 --> 01:08:39,373
I love you too.

1148
01:08:39,628 --> 01:08:40,995
But on one condition.

1149
01:08:41,702 --> 01:08:44,568
Do not go and listen songs now.

1150
01:08:45,369 --> 01:08:46,620
What to do then?

1151
01:08:48,253 --> 01:08:49,411
Oh, God!

1152
01:08:58,265 --> 01:09:00,362
Beautiful frame!

1153
01:09:00,759 --> 01:09:02,095
My evil eye may fall on you!

1154
01:09:03,253 --> 01:09:04,787
She is very sweet.

1155
01:09:04,867 --> 01:09:06,788
Naughty boy,
somehow you succeeded in love.

1156
01:09:07,717 --> 01:09:08,567
Peter!
- Yes.

1157
01:09:08,647 --> 01:09:10,250
Many girls fall for me.
- Yes.

1158
01:09:10,330 --> 01:09:11,458
But I liked only her.

1159
01:09:11,538 --> 01:09:13,647
You know about me.
- Ram!

1160
01:09:13,727 --> 01:09:15,565
No...

1161
01:09:15,645 --> 01:09:18,256
Dear, you should not
fight in public. - Yes.

1162
01:09:18,336 --> 01:09:20,095
After reaching home,
he will punch you.

1163
01:09:20,175 --> 01:09:21,955
Then you punch him.

1164
01:09:23,972 --> 01:09:27,571
Dear, Ram is a very good boy.

1165
01:09:27,651 --> 01:09:30,887
If I had a daughter,
I would have got her married to him.

1166
01:09:31,681 --> 01:09:35,596
You mean that Khushi
is not your daughter, right?

1167
01:09:35,676 --> 01:09:38,945
Let us go. Do not believe him.
- Oh, no! I did not mean it.

1168
01:09:39,260 --> 01:09:41,510
Alright. You are also my daughter.

1169
01:09:42,931 --> 01:09:45,120
This is a good time
to fall at his feet.

1170
01:09:45,200 --> 01:09:48,453
Yes. May you get married soon,

1171
01:09:48,533 --> 01:09:53,477
and lead a happy life!

1172
01:09:54,048 --> 01:09:56,150
I bless you.

1173
01:10:29,229 --> 01:10:31,527
Oh, God!
No, please leave her. Oh, God!

1174
01:10:36,455 --> 01:10:37,897
Why are you hitting us?

1175
01:10:38,746 --> 01:10:40,113
Oh, God!

1176
01:10:47,753 --> 01:10:48,834
Oh, God!

1177
01:10:49,649 --> 01:10:55,898
Nobody else has fought
against me like you.

1178
01:10:56,714 --> 01:11:01,283
I am going to build a huge
multinational company here.

1179
01:11:01,912 --> 01:11:08,377
I am telling you to work
under me there in an a/c room.

1180
01:11:08,457 --> 01:11:10,578
But you refuse to listen to me.

1181
01:11:11,473 --> 01:11:15,175
If you had taken
my warning seriously,

1182
01:11:15,936 --> 01:11:18,446
none of you would
have met with this fate.

1183
01:11:18,526 --> 01:11:24,156
Ram forced me to come to this slum.

1184
01:11:24,236 --> 01:11:25,706
I will not spare him.

1185
01:11:43,155 --> 01:11:45,323
Boss, he is Ram.

1186
01:13:24,127 --> 01:13:25,953
Badrinarayan!

1187
01:13:27,486 --> 01:13:28,765
You are selfish,

1188
01:13:28,845 --> 01:13:33,238
and build huge companies
at the cost of poor people.

1189
01:13:33,984 --> 01:13:36,386
But you do not know me.

1190
01:13:36,929 --> 01:13:41,558
I can quash any number
of people like you.

1191
01:13:41,638 --> 01:13:44,383
I will not allow you to
seize even a foot of our land.

1192
01:13:45,694 --> 01:13:46,787
Do not come here.

1193
01:13:47,490 --> 01:13:48,425
Let's go.

1194
01:13:49,014 --> 01:13:50,254
Leave me.
- No, brother.

1195
01:13:51,024 --> 01:13:52,368
Go away.
- Come on, let's go.

1196
01:13:52,448 --> 01:13:54,976
Go away. Do not come near.

1197
01:13:55,196 --> 01:13:57,272
Let me free.
- Boss, please come away.

1198
01:13:58,061 --> 01:13:59,347
Leave me..
- Do not come close.

1199
01:14:01,230 --> 01:14:02,477
Don't come close.

1200
01:14:03,083 --> 01:14:07,393
Ram, I will not spare you.

1201
01:14:08,857 --> 01:14:10,606
Do not come.
- I will not spare you.

1202
01:14:10,686 --> 01:14:11,651
Come on.
- Let me go.

1203
01:14:11,731 --> 01:14:12,833
Come on.
- Let me go.

1204
01:14:12,913 --> 01:14:14,389
I am saying this in public.

1205
01:14:15,042 --> 01:14:16,272
Let's go.

1206
01:14:20,950 --> 01:14:21,914
This side...

1207
01:14:21,994 --> 01:14:24,227
I do not care for people
like Badrinarayan. - Go that side.

1208
01:14:24,698 --> 01:14:26,016
Nothing will happen to us.

1209
01:14:26,299 --> 01:14:28,164
Forget it. Eat now.

1210
01:14:35,138 --> 01:14:36,983
Oh, God! Power off.

1211
01:14:45,309 --> 01:14:46,313
Who is that?

1212
01:14:46,658 --> 01:14:47,772
The transformer burst.

1213
01:14:48,104 --> 01:14:49,147
We are from the electricity board.

1214
01:15:03,871 --> 01:15:05,050
Who are you?

1215
01:15:08,305 --> 01:15:09,357
Oh, God!

1216
01:15:25,125 --> 01:15:25,935
Oh, God!

1217
01:15:27,835 --> 01:15:28,694
Oh, God!

1218
01:15:29,053 --> 01:15:29,890
Stop.

1219
01:15:32,798 --> 01:15:33,949
They are goons.
- Oh, God!

1220
01:15:45,323 --> 01:15:47,786
Oh, God!
- Come on...

1221
01:15:48,233 --> 01:15:50,655
Oh, God...
- What has happened?

1222
01:15:50,735 --> 01:15:52,491
Take them to the hospital.

1223
01:16:11,568 --> 01:16:14,654
Ram, I cannot afford to
have all these people inside.

1224
01:16:15,237 --> 01:16:16,091
Please take them out.

1225
01:16:16,221 --> 01:16:18,279
Please take them
out and console them.

1226
01:16:18,704 --> 01:16:19,742
God is great!

1227
01:16:31,943 --> 01:16:33,067
Come.

1228
01:16:33,147 --> 01:16:35,537
Hail, the Lord!

1229
01:16:47,010 --> 01:16:47,913
Ram!

1230

gone out of control.

Tragedy has struck.

1232

I am really sorry.

Whoever has done
this horrendous thing,

1240
01:18:52,477 --> 01:18:58,344
I will find them, punish them and
bring justice to all these people.

1241
01:18:58,672 --> 01:19:01,395
I have been doing service
for so many years.

1242
01:19:01,475 --> 01:19:05,402
But I could not save even
one person despite my efforts.

1243
01:19:05,482 --> 01:19:07,612
This definitely is a mass murder.

1244
01:19:07,692 --> 01:19:09,887
Look! The investigation
has begun.

1245
01:19:10,514 --> 01:19:13,561
We cannot comment
on this matter now.

1246
01:19:13,753 --> 01:19:17,206
We will take legal action
against the guilty.

1247
01:19:51,821 --> 01:19:55,062
Such a tragedy took place
when I was not in town.

1248
01:19:56,599 --> 01:19:58,236
I told you before.

1249
01:19:58,316 --> 01:20:01,253
Big shots are behind this.

1250
01:20:01,466 --> 01:20:02,877
I advised you to come,

1251
01:20:02,957 --> 01:20:04,669
to a settlement
without antagonising them.

1252
01:20:04,749 --> 01:20:06,901
But none of you listened to me.

1253
01:20:07,196 --> 01:20:09,562
Who is responsible
for this disaster?

1254
01:20:09,642 --> 01:20:15,344
Sir, don't we have the
right to live in our place?

1255

You are right.

1256
01:20:18,681 --> 01:20:21,935
But I warned you that
they are dreadful people.

1257
01:20:22,015 --> 01:20:24,516
You did not realise it.

Do you want us to
be quiet for that reason?

They attacked womenfolk
and did not care for children.

Do you want us to sit quietly?

Look, corporator Gopalan,
who we voted to power is with us.

1266

I have told him about this incident.

He will give us justice.

1268
01:20:55,210 --> 01:20:58,664
If we keep quiet after
this horrific incident,

1269
01:20:59,760 --> 01:21:03,784
this will also be covered up
like all other incidents in history.

1270
01:21:05,104 --> 01:21:07,687
Badrinarayana will prove,

1271

that all the murders
were actually, suicide.

1272
01:21:12,964 --> 01:21:19,273
Ram, I am advising
you to control your temper.

1273
01:21:19,641 --> 01:21:22,036
Your anger is the
cause for this tragedy.

Sir, we will not get justice if
we remain peaceful on your advice.

If war is the remedy for this,
I am prepared even for that.

your death is close.

But someone else killed before me.

Why will I stay back

I would have settled down
in Dubai or some foreign country,

here if he had killed.

Ram, I have never loved anyone
in my life, as I love you.

1335
01:27:26,374 --> 01:27:30,758
After father left us,
mother was scared of this society,

1336
01:27:30,838 --> 01:27:32,564
and brought me up
with strict values.

1337
01:27:34,284 --> 01:27:40,616
I realised the meaning of
love after you came into my life.

1338
01:27:41,889 --> 01:27:43,485
She is a very self-respecting woman.

1339
01:27:44,102 --> 01:27:46,749
She will go to any level
to maintain her dignity.

1340
01:27:47,514 --> 01:27:51,322
Now you are the target
of her self-respect.

1341
01:27:51,646 --> 01:27:56,784
She has decided to get me married
to her friend's son next month.

1342
01:27:57,280 --> 01:28:03,078
I know you are grieving over the
death of your near and dear ones.

1343
01:28:04,216 --> 01:28:05,798
I am not a selfish girl,

1344
01:28:06,426 --> 01:28:09,831
to tell you to come
and talk for me in this situation.

1345
01:28:10,167 --> 01:28:13,952
Even if you come,
my mother will not agree.

1346
01:28:16,236 --> 01:28:19,243
I do not know how my life
will be in future, without you.

1347

That...

1350
01:28:43,236 --> 01:28:45,720
You have come to say that
you love my daughter Khushi...

1351

You want to marry her?

1352
01:28:48,532 --> 01:28:53,210
And you will take care of her
like a queen. Am I right?

1353
01:28:54,830 --> 01:28:58,673
I believed in the same
words twenty-two years ago.

1354
01:28:58,924 --> 01:29:01,654
But today I and my
daughter lead a lonely life,

1355
01:29:02,608 --> 01:29:04,530
though we have everything.

1356
01:29:09,640 --> 01:29:11,705
Peter is responsible for this.

1357
01:29:15,298 --> 01:29:16,956
What?
- I will never allow,

1358
01:29:17,036 --> 01:29:19,079
my daughter to be
betrayed like I was.

1359
01:29:20,589 --> 01:29:23,128
Peter... Khushi are they...

1360
01:29:24,819 --> 01:29:25,925
Madam, are you Janaki?

1361
01:29:27,127 --> 01:29:28,528
Did he tell you about me?

1362
01:29:29,104 --> 01:29:30,095
What did he say?

1363
01:29:30,689 --> 01:29:33,388
Did he say that he loved
a girl and then deserted her?

1364
01:29:33,468 --> 01:29:36,765
Madam, you have misunderstood Peter.

1365
01:29:36,993 --> 01:29:38,620
How do you say that
I misunderstood him?

1366
01:29:39,614 --> 01:29:43,746
He cursed the unborn child.
Is it a misunderstanding?

1367
01:29:44,577 --> 01:29:46,831
I was in the final stages
of pregnancy when I left the house.

1368
01:29:46,911 --> 01:29:49,701
But he never bothered to
console me and bring me back.

1369
01:29:49,906 --> 01:29:51,164
Is it a misunderstanding?

1370
01:29:51,534 --> 01:29:54,339
I informed him after
the child was born.

1371
01:29:54,419 --> 01:29:55,832
But he did not come
home to see his daughter.

1372
01:29:55,912 --> 01:29:57,260
Did I misunderstand him for that?

1373
01:29:57,643 --> 01:29:59,446
I can understand your pain.

1374
01:30:00,006 --> 01:30:02,668
But you have deceived
yourself all these years,

1375
01:30:02,949 --> 01:30:07,234
without knowing the truth
or understanding Peter.

1376
01:30:09,518 --> 01:30:12,389
Madam, you think that
Peter did not look for you.

1377
01:30:13,124 --> 01:30:15,409
Actually, Peter came
in search of you.

1378
01:30:16,203 --> 01:30:20,033
He came to your house
to see you and the child.

1379
01:30:20,113 --> 01:30:24,397
Though you were there, your brother
gave a missing complaint about you,

1380
01:30:24,580 --> 01:30:28,463
held Peter responsible for that
and did not allow you both to unite.

1381
01:30:28,543 --> 01:30:31,597
The police tortured Peter a lot.

1382
01:30:31,677 --> 01:30:34,939
Peter had to undergo punishment
though he was innocent.

1383
01:30:35,267 --> 01:30:39,142
He searched the entire city of
Mysore to meet you and the child,

1384
01:30:39,222 --> 01:30:41,208
and to ask for your forgiveness.

1385
01:30:41,288 --> 01:30:42,534
But he could not find you.

1386
01:30:42,909 --> 01:30:45,382
When he came to know
that you are in Bangalore,

1387
01:30:45,638 --> 01:30:48,243
he shifted and started
living here for your sake.

1388
01:30:48,323 --> 01:30:52,197
We have never seen a day pass
without Peter thinking about you.

1389
01:30:52,409 --> 01:30:56,426
Had you been patient and
listened to Peter at least once,

1390
01:30:57,090 --> 01:31:00,916
Khushi would have
got a father's love also.

1391
01:31:15,703 --> 01:31:17,933
I committed a grave mistake, Ram.

1392
01:31:18,655 --> 01:31:20,758
It was a big mistake.

1393
01:31:22,289 --> 01:31:27,181
I want to see Peter and ask
him to forgive me. Will you take me?

1394
01:31:27,698 --> 01:31:29,220
Please take me.

1395
01:31:29,991 --> 01:31:33,086
I will call him just
now and ask for his location.

1396
01:31:37,030 --> 01:31:41,574
'The number you are calling
is switched off now.'

1397
01:31:41,812 --> 01:31:43,451
'Please call after some time.'

1398
01:31:44,408 --> 01:31:48,020
Peter's line is switched off.

1399
01:31:48,100 --> 01:31:51,924
I will come tomorrow
morning and take you.

1400
01:31:55,757 --> 01:31:56,708
Thank you, Ram.

1401
01:32:05,812 --> 01:32:08,424
The day Peter came to my house,

1402
01:32:09,657 --> 01:32:14,668
if I had not been angry
and spoken to him calmly,

1403
01:32:17,079 --> 01:32:19,959
we would not have been separated.

1404
01:32:22,249 --> 01:32:23,126
Mother...

1405
01:32:52,025 --> 01:32:53,614
'He is the same person!'

1406
01:32:53,694 --> 01:32:56,062
What are you doing?

1407
01:32:56,142 --> 01:32:57,960
Come on.

1408
01:32:58,494 --> 01:33:00,507
Hey, move.

1409
01:33:00,587 --> 01:33:01,487
'Who is he?'

1410
01:33:03,590 --> 01:33:05,533
Boss, you are naughty.

1411
01:33:14,938 --> 01:33:16,493
[Indistinct chatter]

1412
01:33:30,829 --> 01:33:33,271
It was nice...

1413
01:33:37,254 --> 01:33:38,109
Boss...

1414
01:33:49,410 --> 01:33:50,229
We wouldn't have been so tense,

1415
01:33:50,309 --> 01:33:52,598
if you had killed Ram
along with those twenty people.

1416
01:33:53,274 --> 01:33:57,297
He has pledged in public
that he will kill us.

1417
01:33:57,377 --> 01:34:01,028
Look, kill him before
he comes to us.

1418
01:34:01,108 --> 01:34:03,565
He should not know who
is behind those murders.

1419
01:34:03,645 --> 01:34:06,983
Boss, do not worry.

1420
01:34:07,318 --> 01:34:12,150
He will be confused
why our boys attacked him.

1421
01:34:16,392 --> 01:34:20,482
I will kill him for a silly reason.

1422
01:34:27,841 --> 01:34:28,906
Gopal, sir!

1423
01:34:30,671 --> 01:34:31,531
Gopal, sir!

1424
01:34:31,611 --> 01:34:34,554
Oh, God! Peter has seen us.

1425
01:34:34,634 --> 01:34:35,725
Go and kill him.

1426
01:34:36,578 --> 01:34:37,458
Kill him first.

1427
01:34:38,407 --> 01:34:40,946
Gopalan, sir, they are the killers.

1428
01:34:42,495 --> 01:34:44,862
They killed our people.

1429
01:34:57,379 --> 01:34:58,562
Gopalan, sir!

1430
01:35:01,501 --> 01:35:03,856
People treated you as their God.

1431
01:35:03,936 --> 01:35:05,712
You are a sinner.

1432
01:35:06,306 --> 01:35:07,408
You will not live.

1433
01:35:43,048 --> 01:35:44,479
Peter!

1434
01:35:57,043 --> 01:35:59,152
Oh, God!

1435
01:37:02,913 --> 01:37:05,314
Father...

1436
01:38:05,122 --> 01:38:06,735
Father...

1437
01:39:44,340 --> 01:39:46,044
Sir, do not worry.

1438
01:39:46,794 --> 01:39:49,093
It is my responsibility
to clear the slums soon,

1439
01:39:49,173 --> 01:39:51,695
and hand over the land to you.

1440
01:39:52,673 --> 01:39:55,101
This is also a type
of service to the country.

1441
01:39:58,945 --> 01:40:02,028
Boss, do not worry. I am here.

1442
01:40:02,108 --> 01:40:03,546
Consider your work done.

1443
01:40:07,516 --> 01:40:10,493
Ram, it is not wrong
to fight against injustice.

1444
01:40:11,353 --> 01:40:14,380
But we should not lose
our people in that fight.

1445
01:40:14,761 --> 01:40:16,670
I do not mean that
your anger is a mistake.

1446
01:40:17,081 --> 01:40:19,522
But there is no remedy to
the disaster that happened.

1447
01:40:19,602 --> 01:40:23,014
If you had not acted in vengeance,
we could have saved Peter.

1448
01:40:24,107 --> 01:40:26,179
All these days, I thought
that Badrinarayan is our enemy,

1449
01:40:26,259 --> 01:40:27,556
and was fighting against him.

1450
01:40:28,850 --> 01:40:31,419
But Peter has been killed.

1451
01:40:32,520 --> 01:40:35,106
It means Peter knows
the real culprit.

1452
01:40:35,699 --> 01:40:39,510
Raja, sir, I feel he is
amongst us and is betraying us.

1453
01:40:39,858 --> 01:40:41,523
Why don't you understand?

1454
01:40:42,466 --> 01:40:44,241
Many children have
lost their parents...

1455
01:40:44,321 --> 01:40:45,475
And parents have
lost their children.

1456
01:40:46,372 --> 01:40:48,015
They have some security
in life because of,

1457
01:40:48,095 --> 01:40:50,458
the life and health insurance policy
that you made them take.

1458
01:40:53,865 --> 01:40:54,691
Listen!

1459
01:40:55,587 --> 01:40:57,000
Take responsibility,

1460
01:40:57,270 --> 01:41:00,785
to get the insurance money
for the aggrieved families.

1461
01:41:01,088 --> 01:41:03,674
Do not be furious.
Do what is required now.

1462
01:41:06,124 --> 01:41:08,195
Greetings to your family.

1463
01:41:08,482 --> 01:41:10,873
Greetings.
- Welcome to the Insurance company.

1464
01:41:11,125 --> 01:41:12,225
You are welcome.

1465
01:41:13,200 --> 01:41:17,360
What benefit will I get if I take
a policy from your company?

1466
01:41:17,440 --> 01:41:21,989
I mean, will you take
us to Bangkok or Pattaya?

1467
01:41:22,823 --> 01:41:24,181
You can flatter him later.

1468
01:41:24,600 --> 01:41:26,642
Now listen to the need
for taking insurance.

1469
01:41:26,722 --> 01:41:28,200
Boss will speak now.

1470
01:41:28,280 --> 01:41:31,186
Sir, what will you do
if you meet with an accident,

1471
01:41:31,266 --> 01:41:33,675
while you were coming to our office?

1472
01:41:33,755 --> 01:41:34,746
Say something.

1473
01:41:34,826 --> 01:41:35,925
We would have gone to the hospital.

1474
01:41:36,494 --> 01:41:37,503
You would have gone
and paid the bill.

1475
01:41:37,644 --> 01:41:39,255
But if you had taken
insurance from our company,

1476
01:41:39,335 --> 01:41:40,292
our boss would have paid for it.

1477
01:41:40,487 --> 01:41:43,605
If you had not taken
insurance policy from us,

1478
01:41:43,685 --> 01:41:47,480
and died while walking on the road,
what would you have done?

1479
01:41:47,560 --> 01:41:50,415
Boss, we pity them for not
taken an insurance policy.

1480
01:41:50,750 --> 01:41:55,150
Suppose both of you had died
and your daughter had survived,

1481
01:41:55,230 --> 01:41:56,290
what would you have done?

1482
01:41:56,370 --> 01:41:58,500
Boss, where will she live then?

1483
01:41:58,580 --> 01:42:00,525
They have not taken
insurance policy.

1484
01:42:00,605 --> 01:42:03,513
Suppose you and your
daughter had died...

1485
01:42:03,868 --> 01:42:04,674
Oh, God!

1486
01:42:04,754 --> 01:42:09,191
And only your wife had survived,
what would you have done?

1487
01:42:09,271 --> 01:42:12,448
The locals would not have
spared her. Aunt has a good figure.

1488
01:42:13,357 --> 01:42:16,637
Everyone will be ready to marry her.

1489
01:42:16,717 --> 01:42:18,430
If you had taken our
company insurance policy,

1490
01:42:18,510 --> 01:42:19,783
our boss would have married her.

1491
01:42:19,863 --> 01:42:22,581
Shut up, you rascal.
Do not blabber.

1492
01:42:22,661 --> 01:42:24,715
He speaks nonsense.

1493
01:42:24,795 --> 01:42:29,638
I mean that our company
will serve her as a husband.

1494
01:42:29,934 --> 01:42:32,018
I meant it would serve
her like a husband.

1495
01:42:32,854 --> 01:42:33,755
Listen to me.

1496
01:42:33,989 --> 01:42:38,824
You will be in severe problem
if anything happens to you.

1497
01:42:38,904 --> 01:42:40,936
If you take insurance
from our company,

1498
01:42:41,016 --> 01:42:42,816
suppose you lose your hand...

1499
01:42:43,039 --> 01:42:44,285
We will help you.

1500
01:42:44,876 --> 01:42:45,924
If you lose your leg?

1501
01:42:46,230 --> 01:42:48,000
We will help you
lead a secure life.

1502
01:42:48,080 --> 01:42:50,641
Suppose you die...
- Sir!

1503
01:42:57,907 --> 01:42:58,821
I am sorry, sir.

1504
01:43:01,178 --> 01:43:04,371
No one should be in trouble.

1505
01:43:05,978 --> 01:43:11,491
More than us, our dependents
should not have any problem.

1506
01:43:13,709 --> 01:43:15,660
Suppose anything happens to you...

1507
01:43:17,283 --> 01:43:18,325
No, I do not wish for it.

1508
01:43:19,793 --> 01:43:25,734
If it happens, the insurance
will help your family.

1509
01:43:27,846 --> 01:43:29,282
It is not in
the way he is explaining.

1510
01:43:30,569 --> 01:43:32,839
Sorry, sir.
- Never mind.

1511
01:43:33,911 --> 01:43:34,745
Sorry.

1512
01:43:35,637 --> 01:43:38,738
Sir, please get the
insurance claim amount,

1513
01:43:39,332 --> 01:43:41,549
of all the deceased
persons in our area soon.

1514
01:43:41,740 --> 01:43:42,570
Sure.

1515
01:43:42,757 --> 01:43:43,570
Bashir!
- Boss?

1516
01:43:43,650 --> 01:43:44,962
Bring the file.
- Okay, boss.

1517
01:43:46,373 --> 01:43:51,500
I will follow it up. I will
get the insurance claims settled.

1518
01:43:51,580 --> 01:43:52,555
Do not worry.
- Thank you, sir.

1519
01:43:52,867 --> 01:43:53,718
Boss!

1520
01:44:12,909 --> 01:44:14,985
'I said I will give my blood.'

1521
01:44:15,065 --> 01:44:17,733
But they wanted A -ve group.

1522
01:44:18,124 --> 01:44:19,394
'A -ve?'

1523
01:44:25,234 --> 01:44:28,757
Brother, what is aunt's
blood group?

1524
01:44:28,837 --> 01:44:30,066
O +ve.

1525
01:44:30,330 --> 01:44:31,663
'It is B +ve here.'

1526
01:44:32,001 --> 01:44:35,706
Suresh, what is mother
and sister's blood group?

1527
01:44:35,786 --> 01:44:40,092
Mother is A -ve, sister's is AB +ve.

1528
01:44:40,870 --> 01:44:42,380
'AB +ve?'

1529
01:44:43,434 --> 01:44:44,674
It is A +ve here.

1530
01:44:45,183 --> 01:44:49,266
Sir, the blood groups of
our people have changed.

1531
01:44:49,531 --> 01:44:53,630
No. It is in the same order.

1532
01:44:53,879 --> 01:44:57,128
No, sir.
Everybody's group has changed.

1533
01:44:58,648 --> 01:44:59,619
Just a minute.

1534
01:44:59,699 --> 01:45:00,548
Bashir!
- Yes, boss?

1535
01:45:00,628 --> 01:45:02,529
Bring the other file.
- Okay, boss.

1536
01:45:07,567 --> 01:45:08,475
Boss, take.

1537
01:45:09,331 --> 01:45:10,509
This file has all the details.

1538
01:45:21,137 --> 01:45:25,091
Hey! What is your blood group?
- B +ve.

1539
01:45:25,171 --> 01:45:28,910
Kumar, what is your blood group?
- O -ve.

1540
01:45:28,990 --> 01:45:30,945
Sir, all these are right.

1541
01:45:31,619 --> 01:45:36,233
It means only the blood groups
of the dead persons are different.

1542
01:45:41,371 --> 01:45:42,491
Khushi!
- 'Yes, Ram.'

1543
01:45:42,571 --> 01:45:46,265
Go to all house in your area
and collect death certificates.

1544
01:45:46,345 --> 01:45:47,152
'Okay.'

1545
01:45:47,352 --> 01:45:51,487
Sir, which lab gave
the health report?

1546
01:45:56,948 --> 01:45:57,797
I am sorry.

1547
01:46:00,908 --> 01:46:04,120
Sir, I need to take a blood test.

1548
01:46:04,489 --> 01:46:05,838
We are closing now.
Come in the morning.

1549
01:46:06,072 --> 01:46:07,416
Blood group change?

1550
01:46:11,355 --> 01:46:12,185
Who are you?

1551
01:46:12,265 --> 01:46:14,723
You changed
the blood group of twenty people?

1552
01:46:15,283 --> 01:46:16,855
Can't you do it for me?

1553
01:46:18,147 --> 01:46:20,153
Do you know who
is responsible for this?

1554
01:46:20,233 --> 01:46:22,823
I have come to know that.

1555
01:46:23,736 --> 01:46:27,467
Please leave me.
I cannot tell you his name.

1556
01:46:27,547 --> 01:46:31,016
If you utter his name, you and
your family will die. Right?

1557
01:46:32,432 --> 01:46:35,660
You are ready to die for your family
but not ready to tell the truth.

1558
01:46:35,740 --> 01:46:36,900
I will not tell.
- Will you not say?

1559
01:46:36,980 --> 01:46:37,901
No. I will not.

1560
01:46:41,149 --> 01:46:41,985
God!

1561
01:46:51,065 --> 01:46:53,260
You are unable to bear this pain.

1562
01:46:53,340 --> 01:46:55,466
Do you have the guts to die?

1563
01:46:57,874 --> 01:46:59,675
I will say.

1564
01:47:01,632 --> 01:47:02,467
Who is he?

1565
01:47:03,214 --> 01:47:05,352
Corporator Gopal, sir.

1566
01:47:06,858 --> 01:47:08,405
Gopal, sir!

1567
01:47:14,078 --> 01:47:15,401
What are you saying?

1568
01:47:16,325 --> 01:47:18,354
Why does he do this?

1569
01:47:18,434 --> 01:47:21,213
Sir, I do not know the reason.

1570
01:47:21,555 --> 01:47:24,113
But I was forced into it.

1571
01:47:25,173 --> 01:47:26,309
Do you want me to believe this?

1572
01:47:27,067 --> 01:47:29,407
I swear on my mother.
I am telling the truth.

1573
01:47:29,610 --> 01:47:32,167
Please believe me.
Leave me.

1574
01:47:32,247 --> 01:47:33,559
Please spare me.

1575
01:47:33,869 --> 01:47:35,465
How dare you come to my house,

1576
01:47:35,545 --> 01:47:38,777
and ask me to vacate
it before my boys?

1577
01:47:42,431 --> 01:47:44,371
'Sir, nothing will happen.'

1578
01:47:45,399 --> 01:47:46,211
'Be calm.'

1579
01:47:46,819 --> 01:47:47,927
'Kill him.'

1580
01:47:49,152 --> 01:47:50,274
'Right.'

1581
01:47:54,993 --> 01:47:56,009
Come on.

1582
01:47:59,823 --> 01:48:01,406
Sir!
- Ram, save me.

1583
01:48:01,533 --> 01:48:03,266
Sir! Sir!
- They will kill me.

1584
01:48:03,346 --> 01:48:05,414
Please, Ram. They attacked me.

1585
01:48:05,494 --> 01:48:08,865
Someone is chasing me.
They will kill me.

1586
01:48:08,945 --> 01:48:11,060
Sir, do one thing.
- Please, Ram. Save me.

1587
01:48:11,140 --> 01:48:13,016
Send me your live location.
- Okay, okay.

1588
01:48:15,866 --> 01:48:16,707
Darn!

1589
01:48:18,895 --> 01:48:19,744
Stop!

1590
01:48:23,518 --> 01:48:25,203
Ram, where are you?
- Very close.

1591
01:48:25,283 --> 01:48:28,214
Come soon. - Protect yourself
for a few minutes.

1592
01:48:28,592 --> 01:48:31,556
Then no one will be
able to save them from me.

1593
01:48:41,841 --> 01:48:42,671
Leave me.

1594
01:48:43,293 --> 01:48:44,113
Leave me.

1595
01:48:46,460 --> 01:48:47,394
Ram!

1596
01:48:53,157 --> 01:48:54,044
Leave me.

1597
01:48:55,672 --> 01:48:56,512
No!

1598
01:49:01,105 --> 01:49:02,013
No!

1599
01:49:32,743 --> 01:49:33,594
Ram!

1600
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:04,804
Ram!

1601
01:50:12,696 --> 01:50:14,616
Come on. Run away.

1602
01:50:17,968 --> 01:50:18,809
Come.

1603
01:50:24,144 --> 01:50:26,064
Ram, who are they?

1604
01:50:26,276 --> 01:50:28,123
Why are they trying to kill me?

1605
01:50:28,203 --> 01:50:30,697
What was my mistake?
What mistake did I make?

1606
01:50:30,777 --> 01:50:33,649
They are
Corporator Gopal, sir's henchmen.

1607
01:50:34,449 --> 01:50:35,544
Gopal, sir!

1608
01:50:36,717 --> 01:50:41,506
I have seen our
people suffer and die.

1609
01:50:41,870 --> 01:50:43,665
We should not spare that sinner.

1610
01:50:44,013 --> 01:50:45,544
We have to attack him.

1611
01:51:43,380 --> 01:51:47,454
Ram, all their blood groups
match in the death certificates.

1612
01:51:47,969 --> 01:51:48,858
But...

1613
01:51:58,682 --> 01:51:59,508
Ram!

1614
01:52:02,510 --> 01:52:04,515
Sir, be alert.

1615
01:52:05,748 --> 01:52:08,824
You are our only saviour.

1616
01:52:09,110 --> 01:52:10,400
No harm should befall you.

1617
01:52:14,858 --> 01:52:15,668
Ram!

1618
01:52:20,280 --> 01:52:21,654
We have to believe...

1619
01:52:22,642 --> 01:52:25,157
Only then betrayal is possible.

1620
01:52:26,150 --> 01:52:30,400
He called himself
our protector but betrayed us.

1621
01:52:32,358 --> 01:52:35,895
I am scared.
I feel it will not stop here.

1622
01:52:35,975 --> 01:52:39,702
Twenty murders. Peter was killed.
And then the Corporator.

1623
01:52:39,934 --> 01:52:41,434
Attack me on the same day.

1624
01:52:41,628 --> 01:52:45,032
I feel you are the next target.

1625
01:52:45,247 --> 01:52:47,650
I am damn sure.
You have to be careful.

1626
01:52:47,821 --> 01:52:49,083
Do not worry about me.

1627
01:52:49,984 --> 01:52:52,059
Let this matter remain
only between us.

1628
01:52:53,031 --> 01:52:55,579
I will take care of the rest.

1629
01:52:58,660 --> 01:52:59,482
Ram!

1630
01:53:08,652 --> 01:53:09,599
What happened?

1631
01:53:10,322 --> 01:53:14,544
Raja, sir, is the person
who kills people in our area.

1632
01:53:15,091 --> 01:53:15,904
Shut up.

1633
01:53:16,955 --> 01:53:17,906
It is true.

1634
01:53:18,514 --> 01:53:19,349
It is true.

1635
01:53:22,229 --> 01:53:23,038
See this.

1636
01:53:23,118 --> 01:53:24,492
'Hey, brother!'
- 'Brother?'

1637
01:53:24,572 --> 01:53:26,976
'Call the boys who
killed twenty persons in the slum,'

1638
01:53:27,320 --> 01:53:30,255
'and the boys who killed Peter.'

1639
01:53:31,037 --> 01:53:32,756
'Do not miss even a single person.'

1640
01:53:33,648 --> 01:53:35,583
'Payment will be double.
Understand?'

1641
01:53:36,708 --> 01:53:38,398
'You go and bring Ram.'

1642
01:53:39,207 --> 01:53:41,925
'I will go and bring the doctor.'

1643
01:53:42,902 --> 01:53:47,090
'We will kill both
of them in your den.'

1644
01:54:42,251 --> 01:54:43,961
Ram!

1645
01:54:52,104 --> 01:54:52,939
Ram!

1646
01:54:57,190 --> 01:54:58,390
Ram!

1647
01:55:00,037 --> 01:55:01,618
Ram, they have bashed
you up so hard.

1648
01:55:01,872 --> 01:55:03,699
I told you to be careful.

1649
01:55:03,779 --> 01:55:05,151
I said they are not good people.

1650
01:55:07,493 --> 01:55:10,772
They have committed mass murder.

1651
01:55:10,959 --> 01:55:12,258
It means they have
the backing of big shots.

1652
01:55:12,338 --> 01:55:15,669
Did you not know that
we should be silent?

1653
01:55:15,749 --> 01:55:16,714
Did you not know?

1654
01:55:17,409 --> 01:55:19,165
It is over. They will kill us.

1655
01:55:19,427 --> 01:55:22,029
They will kill you and me.

1656
01:55:22,270 --> 01:55:24,508
Everything is over.

1657
01:55:27,850 --> 01:55:31,661
I did not have a single black
mark in my profession till now.

1658
01:55:33,168 --> 01:55:37,402
But today, my life will
become futile because of you.

1659
01:55:40,216 --> 01:55:42,482
Are the dead people
your brothers and sisters,

1660
01:55:42,562 --> 01:55:44,704
your parents or relatives?

1661
01:55:47,212 --> 01:55:49,520
You have fallen to this level.

1662
01:55:49,811 --> 01:55:52,638
Raja, sir is not
responsible for this.

1663
01:55:53,282 --> 01:55:54,116
I am responsible.

1664
01:55:56,587 --> 01:56:00,651
All the deaths in your
area happened because of me.

1665
01:56:07,716 --> 01:56:10,415
Hey! Do you know where this started?

1666
01:56:10,576 --> 01:56:12,250
'The day you took
me to do the free health check-up,'

1667
01:56:12,330 --> 01:56:13,411
'for the people in your area.'

1668
01:56:13,491 --> 01:56:17,440
'Have I built a free hospital
to give free treatment to all?'

1669
01:56:17,520 --> 01:56:19,786
'It was a pure health camp for you.'

1670
01:56:20,037 --> 01:56:23,010
'But I did pure business.'

1671
01:56:23,164 --> 01:56:26,332
'I selected twenty people and
injected the virus into them.'

1672
01:56:26,412 --> 01:56:29,810
'I used them to find out
if the new tablet invented by me,'

1673
01:56:29,890 --> 01:56:32,143
'for the virus actually works.'

1674
01:56:33,086 --> 01:56:36,507
'Gopal, sir joined me
in this medical mafia.'

1675
01:56:36,735 --> 01:56:39,508
'So, I made him contest for the
post of Corporator in your area.'

1676
01:56:39,588 --> 01:56:42,879
'I was giving free treatment
to the people in your area,'

1677
01:56:42,959 --> 01:56:44,528
'so that no one will doubt me.'

1678
01:56:44,777 --> 01:56:46,886
'When I was called
to treat those twenty people,'

1679
01:56:47,173 --> 01:56:51,100
'because they were not well,
I realised from the blood report,'

1680
01:56:51,548 --> 01:56:55,160
'that my medicine has affected them
and my experiment was a failure.'

1681
01:56:55,500 --> 01:56:58,560
'At that time,
I used Badrinarayan's name,'

1682
01:56:58,966 --> 01:57:01,660
'and killed those twenty people.'

1683
01:57:03,606 --> 01:57:06,782
'I thought I was safe.'

1684
01:57:07,200 --> 01:57:12,933
'But Peter saw Gopal, sir
and I killed him.'

1685
01:57:20,672 --> 01:57:21,848
It was confirmed that,

1686
01:57:22,196 --> 01:57:24,400
the people in your area will
die due to my experiment.

1687
01:57:24,700 --> 01:57:26,272
I would have given
a report of natural death,

1688
01:57:26,352 --> 01:57:27,377
and led a peaceful life.

1689
01:57:27,632 --> 01:57:29,210
'But I was tense,'

1690
01:57:29,339 --> 01:57:32,546
'because of the insurance policies
that you had taken for your people.'

1691
01:57:34,436 --> 01:57:37,129
Gopal, sir, why did you
agree to do the insurance?

1692
01:57:37,851 --> 01:57:41,535
Why? I did so that
they will vote for me.

1693
01:57:41,722 --> 01:57:43,554
Fool, damn it!

1694
01:57:44,503 --> 01:57:47,695
Idiot! Who will insure sick people?

1695
01:57:48,421 --> 01:57:50,377
Oh, God! I forgot about it.

1696
01:57:50,715 --> 01:57:53,299
I have injected the virus
into twenty people.

1697
01:57:53,622 --> 01:57:56,444
If the insurance guys
conduct blood tests and report,

1698
01:57:57,513 --> 01:57:58,914
I will be caught.

1699
01:57:59,316 --> 01:58:02,102
Exchange the blood samples
and change the reports.

1700
01:58:02,182 --> 01:58:04,482
'I came to know from my aide that,'

1701
01:58:04,562 --> 01:58:05,933
'the lab reporter
has told the truth.'

1702
01:58:06,057 --> 01:58:08,805
I am sorry. - 'So, your role
comes to an end today.'

1703
01:58:11,071 --> 01:58:12,703
You have to die.

1704
01:58:25,474 --> 01:58:27,581
Hello, Ram, save me.

1705
01:58:27,661 --> 01:58:28,980
I am very scared.

1706
01:58:29,060 --> 01:58:31,623
I am very scared.
They will kill me.

1707
01:58:31,703 --> 01:58:32,573
Please, Ram.

1708
01:58:38,456 --> 01:58:39,286
Is it okay?

1709
01:58:39,499 --> 01:58:41,318
Ram! Hello, Ram!

1710
01:58:41,398 --> 01:58:43,438
Ram! Save me.

1711
01:58:43,518 --> 01:58:46,628
'I sent Bikli to Raja, sir
to keep an eye on him.'

1712
01:58:46,708 --> 01:58:48,870
He joined for work
only a day before.

1713
01:58:49,269 --> 01:58:52,487
But I did not know
that we will join hands.

1714
01:58:52,684 --> 01:58:56,228
If we had joined hands earlier,
our work would have been easier.

1715
01:58:59,301 --> 01:59:03,172
Never mind. Both of us
belong to the same category now.

1716
01:59:03,810 --> 01:59:06,939
You need people
and I need the place.

1717
01:59:07,019 --> 01:59:09,186
Both of us want...
- Ram.

1718
01:59:09,970 --> 01:59:11,407
How is it possible?

1719
01:59:11,983 --> 01:59:16,477
We spend millions of rupees to study
medicine and to build hospitals.

1720
01:59:16,795 --> 01:59:20,391
Do you want us to take
a paltry sum as fees and keep quiet?

1721
01:59:22,020 --> 01:59:22,834
Idiot!

1722
01:59:23,333 --> 01:59:26,026
If there is no disease,
what work will we have?

1723
01:59:26,172 --> 01:59:29,015
So, we create new viruses.

1724
01:59:29,706 --> 01:59:32,134
We invent anonymous diseases.

1725
01:59:32,214 --> 01:59:34,345
And we discover medicines for that.

1726
01:59:34,755 --> 01:59:37,940
We get orphans, poor people,

1727
01:59:38,020 --> 01:59:40,473
and slum dwellers like
you to carry out our experiments.

1728
01:59:41,776 --> 01:59:44,402
We make good use of them.

1729
01:59:46,203 --> 01:59:47,834
Despite committing
so many murders,

1730
01:59:47,914 --> 01:59:49,803
I did not touch your family.

1731
01:59:50,377 --> 01:59:51,966
You should have kept quiet.

1732
01:59:53,394 --> 01:59:55,341
I should not have allowed
you to reach this stage.

1733
01:59:56,217 --> 01:59:58,114
But I will not spare you today.

1734
01:59:59,043 --> 02:00:00,965
Kill him.

1735
02:00:14,400 --> 02:00:15,218
Darn!

1736
02:00:25,824 --> 02:00:29,757
Wait for two minutes.
I will come now.

1737
02:00:32,551 --> 02:00:34,788
Hey, Hariprasad!

1738
02:00:36,163 --> 02:00:41,979
I knew that you betrayed us.

1739
02:00:43,933 --> 02:00:46,248
What sin did our people do?

1740
02:00:47,193 --> 02:00:49,792
One person comes
and demands our land.

1741
02:00:50,746 --> 02:00:53,681
Another person turns
us into a vote bank.

1742
02:00:56,348 --> 02:00:59,868
And people like you come
to us to take our lives.

1743
02:01:04,654 --> 02:01:08,440
A doctor always
tries to save a life.

1744
02:01:08,661 --> 02:01:11,725
But you treated our
people as guinea pigs,

1745
02:01:11,805 --> 02:01:15,340
for your greed.

1746
02:01:16,864 --> 02:01:19,875
You have killed innocent people.

1747
02:01:24,549 --> 02:01:27,845
You killed our beliefs.

1748
02:01:32,100 --> 02:01:35,579
You killed humanity.

1749
02:01:38,326 --> 02:01:43,907
Hey, Hariprasad,
you carried out your plan...

1750
02:01:44,597 --> 02:01:50,405
But only two persons
will get out of here.

1751
02:02:17,918 --> 02:02:21,182
'When I went to claim
insurance money for our people,'

1752
02:02:21,262 --> 02:02:23,512
'I saw that their blood groups
were changed.'

1753
02:02:23,807 --> 02:02:26,703
'When I came to know that
Gopal, sir, was responsible for this,'

1754
02:02:27,035 --> 02:02:28,270
'you called me.'

1755
02:02:38,494 --> 02:02:41,535
'Do you know when
the scene reversed?'

1756
02:02:43,600 --> 02:02:47,561
Ram, all their blood groups
match in the death certificate.

1757
02:02:47,821 --> 02:02:50,128
But their autopsy report shows,

1758
02:02:50,208 --> 02:02:53,566
that they had
multi organ failure. - What?

1759
02:02:54,381 --> 02:02:57,152
Had they not been killed,

1760
02:02:57,232 --> 02:03:02,232
they would have died of
multi-organ failure in a few days.

1761
02:03:05,008 --> 02:03:08,075
Why did you allow
this to become severe?

1762
02:03:08,548 --> 02:03:11,187
If you had done a simple
blood test at the initial stage,

1763
02:03:11,267 --> 02:03:12,517
you would have known.

1764
02:03:13,021 --> 02:03:13,981
Blood test?

1765
02:03:17,478 --> 02:03:19,909
Take their blood samples
and come to the hospital.

1766
02:03:19,989 --> 02:03:20,794
Okay, sir.
- Do not forget.

1767
02:03:20,874 --> 02:03:23,217
Okay, sir.
- Ram, let me go now.

1768
02:03:23,297 --> 02:03:24,390
Doctor, are all of them fine?

1769
02:03:24,470 --> 02:03:27,307
This area is little dirty.
So, it is shared. Nothing to worry about.

1770
02:03:27,387 --> 02:03:33,166
No, sir. Our doctor examined them and
said there are no major problems.

1771
02:03:33,426 --> 02:03:35,896
He also gave some medicines to them.

1772
02:03:36,166 --> 02:03:38,932
What did you say?
Was he giving medicines?

1773
02:03:39,493 --> 02:03:43,831
Did he give these tablets
after conducting the blood test?

1774
02:03:45,475 --> 02:03:47,452
This is really shocking.

1775
02:03:48,204 --> 02:03:50,440
You say he is a good doctor.

1776
02:03:50,859 --> 02:03:53,329
But see here.
There is no tablet name here.

1777
02:03:53,521 --> 02:03:54,855
The company name is not there.

1778
02:03:55,259 --> 02:03:56,593
No batch number.

1779
02:03:57,143 --> 02:04:00,697
These are unapproved medicines.

1780
02:04:00,777 --> 02:04:03,245
These are prepared only
for experimental purpose.

1781
02:04:03,437 --> 02:04:06,944
It is illegal to give
them to the patients.

1782
02:04:07,125 --> 02:04:09,180
It is a crime as per the law.

1783
02:04:09,876 --> 02:04:13,949
Whenever a new medicine is invented,

1784
02:04:14,229 --> 02:04:17,036
we use it on animals first.

1785
02:04:17,805 --> 02:04:20,394
Those animals are
called guinea pigs.

1786
02:04:21,074 --> 02:04:23,108
After observing the success rate,

1787
02:04:23,880 --> 02:04:28,042
and then making sure that
it is not harmful to human beings,

1788
02:04:28,122 --> 02:04:31,596
we give those medicines
to the patients.

1789
02:04:31,845 --> 02:04:32,854
That is the procedure.

1790
02:04:33,020 --> 02:04:35,008
But sometimes, instead of this,

1791
02:04:35,478 --> 02:04:39,626
these medicines are
used directly on humans.

1792
02:04:39,962 --> 02:04:42,395
We call them human guinea pigs.

1793
02:04:42,475 --> 02:04:44,151
Human guinea pigs.

1794
02:04:46,674 --> 02:04:48,098
That is illegal.

1795
02:04:48,343 --> 02:04:50,996
It is an unpardonable
offence as per law.

1796
02:04:52,104 --> 02:04:52,984
Look here.

1797
02:04:54,707 --> 02:04:57,646
In Maharashtra,
Madhya Pradesh & Rajasthan,

1798
02:04:57,916 --> 02:05:03,358
humans were used as
guinea pigs and many died.

1799
02:05:03,727 --> 02:05:07,330
But only a few have been exposed.

1800
02:05:07,807 --> 02:05:09,459
Do you know who they target?

1801
02:05:09,820 --> 02:05:11,639
The poor people of our country.

1802
02:05:12,137 --> 02:05:16,135
They take advantage of
their helplessness and ignorance.

1803
02:05:16,215 --> 02:05:18,674
Then turn them into
their guinea pigs,

1804
02:05:18,754 --> 02:05:24,447
for their experiments under
the pretext of treating them.

1805
02:05:24,802 --> 02:05:29,779
This is a very ugly
face of the medical mafia.

1806
02:05:41,971 --> 02:05:43,590
Useless fellows.

1807
02:05:43,930 --> 02:05:47,218
Could you not kill one person?

1808
02:05:49,655 --> 02:05:51,587
'When I sneaked and saw
you shouting at the boys,'

1809
02:05:51,817 --> 02:05:54,578
'I realised that
Raja, sir is in danger.'

1810
02:05:59,864 --> 02:06:00,673
I think someone came.

1811
02:06:00,753 --> 02:06:03,355
Go and see.
- Okay, sir.

1812
02:06:06,569 --> 02:06:10,247
You are our only saviour.

1813
02:06:10,327 --> 02:06:11,587
You should not come to any harm.

1814
02:06:13,829 --> 02:06:17,386
Raja, sir,
all this is Hariprasad's doing.

1815
02:06:17,938 --> 02:06:19,108
What are you saying?

1816
02:06:20,134 --> 02:06:20,997
Our doctor!

1817
02:06:21,965 --> 02:06:23,310
We should not let him go scot free.

1818
02:06:23,674 --> 02:06:25,410
We will finish him off now.
- No.

1819
02:06:28,676 --> 02:06:30,316
Not only him.

1820
02:06:31,250 --> 02:06:35,415
We will trap all those,

1821
02:06:36,316 --> 02:06:38,686
who are involved with him.

1822
02:06:41,178 --> 02:06:45,939
'At that time,
Raja, sir, called you through Bitta.'

1823
02:06:49,595 --> 02:06:50,454
'Never mind.'

1824
02:06:51,002 --> 02:06:53,617
'Now both of us belong
to the same category.'

1825
02:06:54,094 --> 02:06:57,228
'You need people
and I want the place.'

1826
02:06:57,365 --> 02:06:59,681
'Both of us want...'
- 'Ram.'

1827
02:07:00,430 --> 02:07:01,550
'We want Ram.'

1828
02:07:02,311 --> 02:07:07,312
'But it is not easy to beat him.'

1829
02:07:07,392 --> 02:07:08,205
'Damn it.'

1830
02:07:09,110 --> 02:07:10,272
'Doctor!
- 'Tell me.'

1831
02:07:10,442 --> 02:07:14,199
'If he knows
that I am responsible for this,'

1832
02:07:14,518 --> 02:07:16,145
'he will be very angry.'

1833
02:07:16,780 --> 02:07:18,106
'We should hit him at that time.'

1834
02:07:19,227 --> 02:07:20,039
'Correct.'

1835
02:07:20,119 --> 02:07:22,624
'If you go and tell him this,'

1836
02:07:22,890 --> 02:07:24,214
'he will not believe it.
- What to do?'

1837
02:07:25,152 --> 02:07:26,040
'Take your mobile.'

1838
02:07:26,626 --> 02:07:28,448
'Take your mobile and record it.'

1839
02:07:29,537 --> 02:07:30,907
'Hey, brother!'
- Brother?'

1840
02:07:30,987 --> 02:07:33,410
'Call the boys who killed
twenty persons in the slum.'

1841
02:07:34,207 --> 02:07:35,624
'and the boys who killed Peter.'

1842
02:07:36,428 --> 02:07:38,169
'Do not miss even a single person.'

1843
02:07:38,645 --> 02:07:41,240
'I will go and bring the doctor.'

1844
02:07:43,665 --> 02:07:45,973
We did not imagine that a person,

1845
02:07:47,161 --> 02:07:49,594
who is supposed to save
lives will kill people.

1846
02:07:50,046 --> 02:07:51,810
You have no humane feelings.

1847
02:07:52,724 --> 02:07:55,168
But our people
treated you as God.

1848
02:07:55,412 --> 02:07:58,790
Whenever a demon like you is born,
a person like Ram,

1849
02:07:58,870 --> 02:08:00,237
is also born to kill you.

1850
02:08:01,840 --> 02:08:03,941
You will not be pardoned
even in death.

1851
02:08:04,097 --> 02:08:06,883
A doctor is considered
as God and revered.

1852
02:08:07,449 --> 02:08:11,985
But we did not know
that you are so lowly.

1853
02:08:13,437 --> 02:08:17,464
You died the moment
I came to know the truth.

1854
02:08:18,460 --> 02:08:23,354
Now I should just
make you aware of death.

1855
02:08:24,566 --> 02:08:26,196
Raja, sir!

1856
02:08:30,846 --> 02:08:31,785
Kill him.

1857
02:09:49,729 --> 02:09:50,761
Kill him.

1858
02:10:17,079 --> 02:10:17,909
Go.

1859
02:10:18,486 --> 02:10:19,814
Attack him.

1860
02:11:05,915 --> 02:11:07,025
Do not spare him.

1861
02:11:22,552 --> 02:11:23,471
Kill him.

1862
02:11:34,500 --> 02:11:35,314
No.

1863
02:11:35,950 --> 02:11:36,764
No, Ram.

1864
02:11:54,806 --> 02:11:55,624
'Ram!'

1865
02:11:56,501 --> 02:12:01,202
'The whole world must
know his real identity.'

1866
02:12:02,168 --> 02:12:03,289
'No, sir.'

1867
02:12:03,688 --> 02:12:06,501
'One bad doctor should
not be a blotch,'

1868
02:12:06,978 --> 02:12:12,432
'on the entire medical community
who serve us selflessly.'

1869
02:12:12,999 --> 02:12:15,837
'Our people thought of him as God.'

1870
02:12:16,242 --> 02:12:18,655
'Let him stay that way.'
